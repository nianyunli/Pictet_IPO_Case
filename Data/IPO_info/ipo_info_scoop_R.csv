General Information,"(Note: This is an IPO, but it is a unit offering. IPOScoop has NO CALL on unit offerings. Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one warrant to buy one ordinary share. The company has applied to list the ordinary shares and warrants on NASDAQ under the symbols “RVSN” and “RVSNW” respectively.) We are a development-stage technology company that is seeking to revolutionize railway safety and the data-related market. We believe we have developed cutting edge, Artificial Intelligence, or AI, based, industry-leading technology specifically designed for railways, with investments from Knorr-Bremse, a world-class manufacturer of braking systems and a leading supplier of safety-critical sub-systems for rail and commercial vehicles. Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s national railway company, recognized us in September 2016 as the winner of its MINDBOX competition for our automated early warning systems to prevent railway accidents. Since our founding in April 2016, we have developed unique auxiliary systems for railway safety, based on image processing technology that provide early warnings to train drivers of hazards on and around the railway track, including during severe weather and in all lighting conditions. Our unique system uses special high-resolution cameras to identify objects up to 2,000 meters away, along with a computer unit that uses AI machine learning algorithms to analyze the images, identify objects on or near the tracks, and warn the train driver of the obstacle and potential danger. Our railway detection system includes different types of cameras, including optics, visible light spectrum cameras (video) and thermal cameras that transmit data to a ruggedized on-board computer which is designed to be suitable for the rough environment of a train’s locomotive. Our railway detection and classification system includes an image-processing and machine-learning algorithm that processes the data for identifying potential hazards on and around the track. These algorithms are designed to identify and classify objects such as people, animals, vehicles, bridges, junctions, signs, signals along the track, and anomalies. Our railway detection system actively classifies objects by severity to determine if an alarm should be signaled to the train driver. These data collection and classification capabilities can be extended to further use-cases such as predictive maintenance and big-data analyses.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage precision oncology company developing therapies that target oncogenic drivers for which we are able to genetically select patients we believe will most likely benefit. This approach includes using a tumor-agnostic strategy to select patients based on their tumors’ underlying genetics rather than histology. We have in-licensed product candidates, each with a differentiated profile relative to available therapies, and we intend to continue strengthening our pipeline through focused business development and internal research efforts. Our lead product candidate, RAIN-32 (milademetan, formerly known as DS-3032), is a small molecule, oral inhibitor of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), which is oncogenic in numerous cancers. We in-licensed RAIN-32 in September 2020 based on the results of a Phase 1 clinical trial, which demonstrated meaningful antitumor activity in an MDM2-amplified subtype of liposarcoma (LPS) and other solid tumors. This trial also validated a rationally-designed dosing schedule that has been shown to mitigate safety concerns and widen the therapeutic window of MDM2 inhibition, unlocking the potential for RAIN-32 in a broad range of MDM2-dependent cancers. Based on these data, we anticipate commencing a pivotal Phase 3 trial in LPS in the second half of 2021, a Phase 2 tumor-agnostic basket trial in certain solid tumors in the second half of 2021, and a Phase 2 trial in intimal sarcoma by early 2022.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company built around a team of seasoned industry experts with a shared purpose and a track record of success in discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering therapies that meaningfully improve the lives of patients suffering from severe and rare diseases. Our mission at Rallybio is aligned with our expertise, and we believe we have assembled the best people, partners and science to forge new paths to life-changing therapies. Since our launch in January 2018, we have acquired a portfolio of promising product candidates that consists of five programs, and we are focused on further expanding our portfolio with the goal of making a profound impact on the lives of even more patients. We are drawing on our decades of knowledge and experience with a determination to tackle the undone, the too difficult, the inaccessible – and change the odds for rare disease patients. Our most advanced program is for the prevention of fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, or FNAIT, a potentially life-threatening rare hematological disease that impacts fetuses and newborns. We are evaluating RLYB211, a polyclonal anti-HPA-1a antibody, in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which we believe has established proof of concept for RLYB211 and provides support for our proposed mechanism of action. We plan to move our FNAIT program forward with our lead product candidate, RLYB212, a monoclonal anti-HPA-1a antibody. We submitted a clinical trial application, or CTA, for RLYB212 in July 2021, and subject to the acceptance of our CTA submission, we expect to initiate a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in Germany in the first quarter of 2022.  We are also focused on developing therapies that address diseases of complement dysregulation, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, generalized myasthenia gravis, or gMG, and ophthalmic disorders. RLYB116 is a novel, potentially long-acting, subcutaneously administered inhibitor of complement factor 5, or C5, in development for the treatment of patients with PNH and gMG. We expect to submit a CTA for RLYB116 in the fourth quarter of 2021 to support the initiation of a Phase 1 trial in healthy participants. RLYB114 is a pegylated C5 inhibitor in preclinical development for the treatment of complement-mediated ophthalmic diseases, and we expect to submit a CTA for this product candidate in the first half of 2023. Additionally, in collaboration with Exscientia Limited, or Exscientia, we have two discovery-stage programs focused on the identification of small molecule therapeutics for patients with rare metabolic diseases.

We develop drones – both the products and the software. The company’s business is to provide products, services and solutions to the drone industry. We design, develop, market, and sell drone software and products. Our business emphasis focusses on drones piloted with wearable display devices. These are head mounted displays (“HMDs”) for pilots. HMDs give pilots “first person view” (“FPV”) perspective to control their drone in flight. This is a unique experience where the pilot is interacting with an aircraft through visual immersion. In this augmented virtual reality, the pilot sees only what the drone sees, as if sitting in the pilot seat. This experience is accomplished by live streaming footage from a camera mounted on the nose of the drone directly into specially designed goggles worn by the pilot. The image is transmitted via radio (traditionally analog but increasingly digital) to the pilot. The drone remote control unit, the drone device, and the FPV goggles are all inter-connected via radio. This effect requires sophisticated electronics that transmits visual information with sufficient speed and reliability to allow pilot control over the drone in real-time. Pilots routinely achieve speeds of over 90 mph in racing and other mission critical applications. An FPV pilot must experience a near complete transfer of their visual consciousness into the body of their piloted device. **Revenue and net loss figures are for the nine months ended Jan. 31, 2021, according to the prospectus. **We are a Nevada corporation, originally incorporated in 1984 under the name Oravest International, Inc. in the state of Colorado, and subsequently renamed TimefireVR, Inc. in November 2016, and thereafter renamed Red Cat Holdings, Inc. in July 2019.

We strategically partner with Mr. Sik-Kee Au, our TCM Practitioner, the father of our CEO and director. We have three standardized TCM formulae candidates under development targeting mild, moderate and severe ADHD and ASD conditions. We plan to commence our second research study using the three standardized TCM formulae candidates in the third quarter of 2021. Our TCM formulae candidates are derived from a TCM base formula and an adjustable formula developed by our TCM Practitioner based on his TCM brain theory, known as “Sik-Kee Au TCM Brain Theory™”, and has demonstrated reduced severity in patients’ ADHD and ASD conditions, as reflected in lower ATEC, GARS, VADRS and SNAP-IV-26 assessment scores, using the personalized TCM formula in our first research study. The activity and specificity of the TCM base formula have been optimized by the TCM Practitioner in his prior ADHD and ASD treatments. As of the date hereof, the TCM Practitioner has standardized the adjustable formula into three fixed formulae (“Fixed Adjusted Formula”) for mild, moderate and severe ADHD and ASD conditions. The TCM brain theory is not recognized in general literature of TCM or elsewhere. However, the TCM Practitioner has prescribed the TCM base formula based on his TCM brain theory for over 30 years to treat ADHD, ASD and many neurological illnesses, disorders and degeneration and obtained satisfactory clinical treatment results. Such clinical treatment results are not supported by controlled clinical data or trials. We have been headquartered in Hong Kong since our inception. In October 2020, we opened our California office. Currently, we are not actively developing the U.S. market and will conduct preliminary market research once our TCM products obtain regulatory approvals and achieve success in Hong Kong. We have been keeping books and records in Hong Kong since our inception. Our research study and supply of TCM raw materials are in Hong Kong. As we are still at the stage of conducting TCM research, we have not applied for regulatory approvals, we have no sales, marketing or distribution capabilities or experience and no granted patents or pending patent applications, and we have not generated revenues since inception.

General Information,"The inspiration behind Remitly came when Matt Oppenheimer, our co-founder and CEO, was working in Kenya. There, Matt realized how reliant some families were on the money sent from their loved ones working abroad. He also saw how difficult it was to send and receive money overseas – the process was painful, opaque and expensive. This first-hand look at cross-border remittances was an eye-opener, and Matt became convinced there was a better way. In 2011, Josh Hug and Shivaas, our two other co-founders, joined Matt to start Remitly and began working on the problem immediately. Their goal was to make a difference for immigrant communities by using technology to initially disrupt traditional cross-border remittances. Today, Remitly is a leading digital financial services provider for immigrants and their families in over 135 countries around the world. Looking back over the last 10 years, we have remained committed to our initial goal: to help millions of immigrants send money home in a safe, reliable, and transparent manner. The long-term, trusted relationships we foster with our customers have enabled us to expand our core cross-border remittance product to over 1,700 corridors worldwide and extend our offering to a broader suite of financial services. On June 30, 2021, over 85% of our customers engaged with Remitly on their mobile phones, shifting what traditionally required waiting in line to speak with an agent to the palm of their hands. Historically, our revenue has been substantially derived from remittances to India, the Philippines and Mexico. Remittances sent to these three countries represented approximately 75% of our revenue and send volume in the year ended Dec. 31, 2020. Cross-border remittance and banking are two of the largest financial services markets in the world. The cross-border remittance market alone is estimated to be approximately $1.5 trillion in total migrant remittance inflow volume in 2020. Today, there are over 280 million immigrants worldwide who may be excluded from fair access to everyday financial services used to build wealth and financial security. For them, sending money internationally is often unreliable, inconvenient, and expensive. (Note: Remitly Global priced its IPO on Sept. 22, 2021, at $43 – $1 above the top of its $38-to-$42 price range – on 12.16 million shares, the same number of shares in the prospectus, to raise $522.88 million.

General Information,"Reneo is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of therapies for patients with rare genetic mitochondrial diseases, which are often associated with the inability of mitochondria to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP). We are developing REN001 to modulate genes critical to metabolism and generation of ATP, which is the primary source of energy for cellular processes. REN001 is a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARd) agonist that has been shown to increase transcription of genes involved in mitochondrial function and increase fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and may increase production of new mitochondria. We believe REN001 could benefit patients with genetic mitochondrial myopathies who experience weakness, fatigue, cramping, and wasting of muscle due to the mitochondria’s inability to produce adequate levels of ATP. These patients often struggle to perform everyday activities, and over time, are at risk of experiencing cardiac and multisystem morbidities and have reduced life expectancy. We are initially developing REN001 in three rare genetic diseases that typically present with myopathy and have high unmet medical needs: primary mitochondrial myopathies (PMM), long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorders (LC-FAOD), and glycogen storage disease type V (McArdle disease).

General Information,"Riskified Ltd. was created to provide a fraud-management platform for online merchants. We have built a next-generation eCommerce risk management platform that allows online merchants to create trusted relationships with their consumers. Leveraging machine learning that benefits from a global merchant network, our platform identifies the individual behind each online interaction, helping merchants — our customers — eliminate risk and uncertainty from their business. We drive higher sales and reduce fraud and other operating costs for our merchants and strive to provide superior consumer experiences, as compared to our merchants’ performance prior to onboarding us. We believe legacy fraud platforms and rules-based, in-house solutions are frequently slow, inaccurate, expensive and inflexible. They can often produce the wrong decision—by rejecting good transactions or accepting fraudulent ones—which causes merchants to either lose revenue or incur unnecessary expenses in the form of chargebacks and other fees. Our eCommerce risk management platform is built to solve these problems with proprietary machine learning models that drive an automated decisioning engine. We have designed our platform to be fast, accurate, scalable and cost-effective. It supports our core chargeback guarantee product—which optimizes merchant approval rates—as well as other products that mitigate similar eCommerce risks for those same merchants.

A $59.50 mid-point pricing would give Rivian a market valuation of nearly $52 billion – matching estimates reported last month by The Wall Street Journal and Reuters. The S-1/A filing with the deal’s terms came exactly a month after the company filed its long-awaited S-1 prospectus to go public on Oct. 1, 2021. Rivian submitted a confidential IPO filing with the SEC on Aug. 25, 2021. Rivian’s electric pickup truck, the R1T, retails for about $70,000. Rivian has raised over $10 billion in funding from Amazon, Ford Motor Co. and several Wall Street firms, The New York Times reported. Amazon has ordered 100,000 of its electric delivery vans – see details below from the prospectus.) We design, develop, and manufacture category-defining electric vehicles (“EVs”) and accessories. We sell them directly to customers in the consumer and commercial markets. Our vehicles are complemented by a full suite of proprietary, value-added services that address the entire vehicle lifecycle and deepen our customer relationships. In the consumer market, we launched the R1 platform with our first generation consumer vehicle, the R1T, a two-row five-passenger pickup truck, and began making customer deliveries in September 2021. We plan to launch and commence customer deliveries for the R1S, a three-row seven-passenger sports utility vehicle (“SUV”) in December 2021 following the completion of ongoing vehicle validation and all required testing. Engineered for all of life’s adventures, our Electric Adventure Vehicles combine performance, utility, and efficiency. They are equally capable of rock crawling or carving turns on a mountain road and can leave most sports cars in the rearview mirror. The R1T and R1S are equipped with a proprietary set of advanced technology systems, including vehicle electronics, battery, electric drive, chassis, Driver+, our advanced driver assistance system (“ADAS”), and digital user experience management. These technologies can continuously improve and expand functionality through cloud-enabled over-the-air (“OTA”) updates. In the commercial market, we will launch the Rivian Commercial Vehicle (“RCV”) platform with our first vehicle, the Electric Delivery Van (“EDV”), designed and engineered by Rivian in collaboration with Amazon.com, Inc. (“Amazon”), our first commercial customer. Amazon has ordered, subject to modification as described in the section titled “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions,” an initial volume of 100,000 vehicles globally, representing the largest order of EVs ever.

Robinhood was founded in 2013 by Vladimir Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. Our founders deeply believe that everyone should have access to the financial system. Our mission is to democratize finance for all. We are creating a modern financial services platform for everyone, regardless of their wealth, income or background. The stock market is widely recognized as one of the greatest wealth creators of the last century. But systemic barriers to investing, like expensive commissions, minimum balance requirements and complicated jargon-filled paperwork, have dissuaded millions of people from feeling welcome or able to participate. Over half of 18- to 44-year-olds in the United States know who Robinhood is, according to an internal brand study that we conducted in March 2021. As a further sign of our relevance today, Robinhood reached the No. 1 spot on the Apple App Store multiple times in the first quarter of 2021. As of March 31, 2021, we had 18.0 million Net Cumulative Funded Accounts on our platform, and from Jan. 1, 2015, to March 31, 2021, over half of the customers funding accounts on our platform told us that Robinhood was their first brokerage account. (Note: Robinhood Markets priced its IPO on July 28, 2021, at $38 – the low end of its $38-to-$42 price range – and sold 55 million shares, the same number of shares in the prospectus, to raise $2.09 billion.)",Online brokerage platform and mobile app,2100,2013,Contact Information,"85 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025",(844) 428-5411,http://www.robinhood.com/,"Robinhood Markets, Inc.",Financial Information,$31755.84mil,$1353.45 mil (last 12 months),$-1489.85 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,HOOD,NASDAQ,55.0,$38.00 - $38.00,$2090.0 mil,Goldman Sachs/ J.P.

General Information,"(Note: This is not a traditional IPO. Roblox went public through a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange. The NYSE set a reference price of $45 for the Class A common stock on March 9, 2021, when the direct listing was priced. The stock started trading on the NYSE on March 10, 2021. Background: The company said Feb. 11 that it planned to offer 198.92 million shares, up from 196.7 million shares in its Jan. 8 filing. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were the financial advisors for the direct listing.) The story of Roblox began in 1989 when our founders, David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, programmed a 2D simulated physics lab called Interactive Physics, which would later go on to influence our approach to building the groundwork for Roblox. Students across the world used Interactive Physics to see how two cars would crash, or how they could build destructible houses. In starting Roblox in 2004, we wanted to replicate the inspiration of imagination and creativity we saw in Interactive Physics on a much grander scale by ushering in a new category of human interaction that did not exist at the time. An average of 37.1 million people from around the world come to Roblox every day to connect with friends. Together they play, learn, communicate, explore, and expand their friendships, all in 3D digital worlds that are entirely user-generated, built by our community of over 8 million active developers. We call this emerging category “human co-experience,” which we consider to be the new form of social interaction we envisioned back in 2004. Our platform is powered by user-generated content and draws inspiration from gaming, entertainment, social media, and even toys. Our Roblox human co-experience platform consists of: *The Roblox Client, which lets users explore 3D digital worlds; * The Roblox Studio, the toolset that lets developers and creators build, publish and operate 3D experiences and other content accessed with the Roblox Client, and *TheRoblox Cloud, which includes the services and infrastructure that power our human co-experience platform.",Prepackaged Software,3260,2004,Contact Information,"970 Park Place, San Mateo, California 94403",(888) 858-2569,http://www.roblox.com/,Roblox Corporation,Financial Information,$24774.3mil,$923.9 mil (last 12 months),$-253.3 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,RBLX,NYSE,198.9,$45.00 - $45.00,$8951.4 mil,Goldman Sachs/ Morgan Stanley,-,3/10/2021,Priced,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,

From the prospectus: “We have built a company that recognizes each individual is unique and puts customers in control, rewarding them for their actions. For centuries, traditional insurance companies have grouped people into risk pools and long relied on the ‘law of large numbers’ to produce acceptable pricing on an aggregate basis.

General Information,"We intend to focus our search on companies that operate in the Latin American markets. (Incorporated in the Cayman Islands) We believe that the Latin American region holds a diverse base of numerous public ready businesses seeking capital to fund their operations and achieve long-term growth. However, most companies in the region face hurdles in their pursuit of equity capital through traditional avenues. Late private funding for emerging companies in Latin America remains scarce and expensive, while the local public capital markets outside Brazil have historically been inefficient, illiquid, and limited in depth as compared to the U.S. capital markets. We plan to capitalize on this pent-up demand for growth equity and market access to provide an attractive capital solution for the region’s high-growth private companies. We strongly believe that the growth path for many of these emerging private companies can be accelerated through a Nasdaq listing, access to the broad U.S. institutional investor base, and the type of strategic partnership that our company offers. In pursuit of this goal, our investment thesis is based on three core principles to complete a business combination in Latin America: (i) successful navigation of these markets requires a dedicated team of individuals with long track records of success investing and operating in the region; (ii) successfully capitalizing on the Special Purpose Acquisition Company, or SPAC, as a vehicle requires transaction expertise with the SPAC product and ample experience in structuring business combinations; and (iii) long-term value creation post business combination requires deep understanding of both U.S. public market dynamics and Latin American operating requirements. Based on these principles, Rose Hill was founded and strategically structured to provide a comprehensive array of both regional and product know-how that collectively maximizes our probability of success. Our management team is comprised of individuals that collectively possess: (i) over 60 years of experience and leading roles in more than $250 billion of completed mergers and acquisitions transactions across Latin American markets; (ii) transaction experience leading large teams focused on Latin America, including former Latin American Heads of M&A for Lehman Brothers, Barclays Capital, Scotiabank, and HSBC Brazil, as well as Investment Banking coverage for Morgan Stanley and Infrastructure & Power for Nomura; (iii) deep operational and private equity expertise in the Latin America region; and (iv) experience underwriting and advising SPAC offerings and business combinations. Our independent board of directors was selected to provide expertise across our five main Latin American target markets: Mexico, Colombia, Brazil, Chile, and Peru. These individuals bring over 100 years of combined investing and advising experience across dozens of industries in the region. Our independent director nominees are industry leaders with substantial operational expertise, partners and presidents at leading private equity firms in Latin America, former country CEOs at consulting firms in the region, and former public company senior executives. Our strategic investor in Latin America, Ameris Capital, brings (i) a deep understanding and track record of success investing in the region across multiple asset classes and industries; (ii) relationships with premier long-only investors in Latin America; (iii) an extensive background in creatively structuring deals in the region; and (iv) a wide breadth of public markets expertise.

Series AMZL has been established to own the Amazon.com Services LLC, or Amazon, last-mile delivery station located in Oakley, California. We will use substantially all of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private placements (as defined below) to purchase this property.

General Information,"Founded by Patrick G. Ryan in 2010, we are a rapidly growing service provider of specialty products and solutions for insurance brokers, agents and carriers. We provide distribution, underwriting, product development, administration and risk management services by acting as a wholesale broker and a managing underwriter. Our mission is to provide industry-leading innovative specialty insurance solutions for insurance brokers, agents and carriers. For retail insurance brokers, we assist in the placement of complex or otherwise hard-to-place risks. For insurance carriers, we work with retail and wholesale insurance brokers to source, onboard, underwrite and service these same risks. A significant majority of the premiums we place are bound in the E&S (excess and surplus) market, which includes Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”). Our business was founded to address the growing need for specialists in the increasingly important E&S market. For the year ended Dec. 31, 2020, 70.6% of the total premiums we placed were in the E&S market. The growing relevance of the E&S market has been driven by the rapid emergence of complex high-hazard risks across many insurance lines. This trend continued in 2020, with a record 30 named storms during the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, over 10.3 million acres burned through wildfires in the United States, escalating jury verdicts, a proliferation of cyber threats, novel health risks and the economy’s transformation to a “digital first” mode of doing business.
