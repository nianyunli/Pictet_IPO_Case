General Information,"Latham Group specializes in fiberglass residential in-ground swimming pools, which can be installed more quickly than an in-ground concrete pool. Fiberglass pools give home owners the option of a saltwater pool without the risk of salt corrosion, according to the company, which also points out that saltwater is easier on the skin than water treated with typical pool chemicals. Latham sells swimming pools, pool liners and pool covers in partnership with over 6,000 dealers in 2020. From the prospectus: We are the largest designer, manufacturer and marketer of in-ground residential swimming pools in North America, Australia and New Zealand. We hold the No. 1 market position in North America in every product category in which we compete. We believe that we are the most sought-after brand in the pool industry and the only pool company that has established a direct relationship with the homeowner. We are Latham, The Pool CompanyTM. With an operating history that spans over 60 years, we offer the industry’s broadest portfolio of pools and related products, including in-ground swimming pools, pool liners and pool covers. In 2020, we sold over 8,700 fiberglass pools in the United States, which we believe represents approximately 1 out of every 10 in-ground swimming pools sold in the United States. We have a heritage of innovation. In an industry that has traditionally marketed on a business-to-business basis (pool manufacturer to dealer), we pioneered the first “direct-to-homeowner” digital and social marketing strategy that has transformed the homeowner’s purchase journey. Through this marketing strategy, we are able to create demand for our pools and generate and provide high quality, purchase-ready consumer leads to our dealer partners. In 2020, the first year in which all elements of our digital and social marketing strategy were available to homeowners, we have delivered over 45,000 consumer leads to our dealer network, representing growth of 210% over the prior year. Partnership with our dealers is integral to our collective success, and we have enjoyed long-tenured relationships averaging over 14 years.

General Information,"We are a biotechnology company focused on transforming cancer treatment by developing a platform of novel bispecific antibodies designed to selectively induce gamma-delta T cell-mediated immunity against tumor cells. Our approach activates Vg9Vd2 T cells, a specific and relatively abundant gamma-delta effector T cell subset, upon cross-linking to a selected tumor target by our bispecific gamma-delta T cell engagers, or gamma-delta bsTCEs. These cells have the natural ability to distinguish tumor cells from healthy cells by sensing certain intracellular metabolites that are enriched in cancer cells. Activated Vg9Vd2 T cells are engaged for direct tumor cell killing and, in addition, orchestrate an immunological cascade response that includes activation of innate and adaptive immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Vg9Vd2 T cells belong to the first line of defense against cancer, with potential to elicit potent and durable responses in the clinic. Our preclinical data demonstrate that Vg9Vd2 T cell activation and killing of patient-derived tumor cells by our gamma-delta bsTCEs is potent and specific thereby providing a significant opportunity to address unmet medical needs, if approved.

General Information,"We intend to focus our search for business combination targets in the Travel, Leisure & Hospitality industries, including technology and data companies operating in these industries, although we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, including, without limitation, real estate-related operating, technology and investment companies. We believe that our management team is well suited to identify, source, negotiate and execute an initial business combination with the ultimate goal of pursuing attractive risk-adjusted returns for our shareholders. The Travel, Leisure & Hospitality industries, thriving prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, have been significantly disrupted on account of the pandemic and its associated impact on global travel. Government-imposed shutdowns of travel and associated businesses have created an adverse environment in the near term for the Travel, Leisure & Hospitality industries by significantly contracting revenues streams. As vaccines are distributed globally and government-imposed shutdowns are loosened, we believe this contraction will reverse and these industries will grow significantly, especially to service pent-up demand for the experiential components of travel. This growth in turn will create opportunity for value creation through a strategic business combination with a well-positioned target business primed to capture market share. The essence of the Travel, Leisure & Hospitality industries is the desire for shared human experiences. Virtual mediums cannot adequately replicate the essence of these industries, creating a latent demand during the pandemic for the experiences these industries traditionally offer. We believe the Travel, Leisure & Hospitality industries are, therefore, well positioned to rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic induced contraction and we expect to target companies in this industry that will benefit from the value enhancement strategy we intend to implement through a business combination.",BLANK CHECKS,0,2020,Contact Information,"c/o The LCP Group, L.P. 50 Main Street, Suite 1410 White Plains, New York 10606",(914) 289-0224,,LCP Acquisition Corp.,Financial Information,$250.0mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$0 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,LCPU,NASDAQ,20.0,$10.00 - $10.00,$200.0 mil,Deutsche Bank Securities,-,,Withdrawn,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,

To fulfill this mission, we have built one of the nation’s largest outpatient mental health platforms based on number of clinicians and geographic scale. We are dedicated to improving the lives of our patients by reimagining mental health through a disruptive tech-enabled in-person and virtual care delivery model built to expand access and affordability, improve outcomes and lower overall health care costs. We combine a personalized, digitally-powered patient experience with differentiated clinical capabilities and in-network insurance relationships to fundamentally transform patient access to mental health treatment. By revolutionizing the way mental health care is delivered, we believe we have an opportunity to improve the lives and health of millions of individuals. We employed over 3,300 licensed mental health clinicians through our subsidiaries and affiliated practices across 73 MSAs in 27 states as of March 31, 2021.

Locafy Limited is offering 1.82 million units – up to $10 million in estimated IPO proceeds – at an IPO price expected to be between $4.50 and $6.50 per unit, according to its F-1/A filing dated March 7, 2022. The assumed IPO price is $5.50 per unit. From the prospectus: “The final offering price per unit will be determined through negotiations between us and the representative of the underwriters, after taking into account market conditions and other factors.” Each unit consists of one ordinary share and one warrant. Locafy has applied to list its ordinary shares and warrants on the NASDAQ under the symbols “LCFY” and “LCFYW”.) We are an Australian company currently focused on commercializing our Software as a Service (SaaS) online publishing platform. Key aspects of our platform are patented in the United States. Central to our platform is the ability to publish almost any type of content to almost any device that uses a web browser to display web content. Further to that, our platform programmatically optimizes the published content for local search. Once data is integrated with our platform, the production of pages is largely automated. This enables the publication of large volumes of landing pages optimized for customer relevant search queries for local products and services in target locations. “Local search” is one of the strongest emerging trends in search engine optimization, with consumers increasingly searching for products and services in close proximity to their immediate location. Approximately 46% of all online search is “local”. We provide businesses an automated and cost-effective solution to increase their online visibility. The objective is to increase the likelihood that local consumers will find our customer’s business online when searching for local products and services, regardless of search method. Regardless of whether the consumer is searching using more traditional means, such as by typing, or by using more modern methods such as voice search (e.g., Google Home, Alexa, Siri), a recent emergent trend, the landing pages are designed to be found for relevant search terms, locally. This is achieved through the automated attribution of schema and speakable codes to published content, which ensures that content and the context in which it is used is understood by all device types, including voice assistants. The landing pages produced by our platform contain features that would otherwise require significant manual effort to achieve, or the application of additional and more expensive solutions. Our technology results in fast page load speed and the seamless delivery of content to all device types due to the platform’s adaptive nature of publishing content, and the automated attribution of security. We believe the results recently achieved in multiple markets, including North America, Australia and the UK, demonstrate the capability of our technology. Across 21,960 landing pages published up to November 28, 2021, more than 50% of these pages appeared in page one search results for the target keyword and location, while more than 33% of pages appeared in either the first, second and third positions on Page 1. The importance of Page 1 results is exemplified by consumer behavior studies that found more than 95% of consumers were more likely to enter a new search query than to proceed to page 2 of a search result. Specifically, our technology is able to process structured data provided in standard technical formats (for example, XML, JSON, CSV and XLS) of any quantity, to be published to any web browser and made accessible on any viewing device that uses a browser to display content, including smart phones, tablets, laptops, desktops and wearables (in so far as the content from data feeds can be published on a myriad of devices). Data may be transmitted via Web Application Programming Interface (“API”), File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or local upload. In March 2016, we were granted a patent in the United States (Patent Number US 9286274) relating to this process. **Note: Revenue for the year ended June 30, 2021, was A$2.91 million and the total comprehensive loss for the year was A$997,419, according to the prospectus.

The technologies were highlighted in the NCI’s Annual Plan and Budget Proposal for FY2020 to Congress as one of the year’s significant advances in cancer prevention.
