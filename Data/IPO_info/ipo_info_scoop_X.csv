General Information,"We are a biotechnology company focused on harnessing the immune system to achieve deep and durable clinical responses to improve the lives of patients with cancer. We have built our geographically precise solutions (GPS) platform to rapidly engineer novel molecules, including cytokines and other biologics, that are designed to optimize their therapeutic index by geographically localizing their activity inside tumors. Current immuno-oncology, or I-O, therapies have curative potential for patients with cancer; however, their potential is significantly curtailed by systemic toxicity that results from activity of the therapeutic molecule outside the tumor microenvironment, or TME. Our molecules are engineered to localize activity within the TME with minimal systemic effects, resulting in the potential to achieve enhanced anti-tumor activity.  We are advancing a number of geographically precise, or tumor-selective, agents through various stages of development. Our most advanced product candidates are: -XTX101, an anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, or anti-CTLA-4, monoclonal antibody, or mAb, which received IND (investigational new drug) clearance from the FDA in June 2021; we recently initiated a Phase 1/2 trial to evaluate XTX101 in patients with solid tumors, and -XTX202, -an interleukin 2, or IL-2, therapy, which received IND clearance from the FDA in October 2021, and we anticipate initiating a Phase 1/2 trial in the first quarter of 2022 to evaluate XTX202 in patients with multiple solid tumor types. We are also advancing our tumor-selective IL-12 product candidate, XTX301, with the goal of submitting an IND in the second half of 2022, and we are currently pursuing preclinical studies for our tumor-selective IL-15 product candidate, XTX401. We also plan to continue to leverage our GPS platform to develop additional immunotherapies, including product candidates with a range of tumor-targeting approaches.

General Information,"Our mission is to accelerate innovation by providing real time, equitable access to global manufacturing capacity and demand. Our vision is to drive efficiency, sustainability and innovation by lowering the barriers to entry to the manufacturing ecosystem. We are a leading AI-enabled marketplace for on-demand manufacturing, transforming one of the largest industries in the world. We use our proprietary technology to create a marketplace that enables buyers to efficiently source on-demand manufactured parts and assemblies, and empowers sellers of manufacturing services to grow their businesses. We define “buyers” as individuals who have placed an order to purchase on-demand parts or assemblies on our platform. Our buyers include engineers, product designers, procurement and supply chain personnel, inventors and business owners from businesses of a variety of sizes, ranging from self-funded start-ups to Fortune 100 companies. We define “accounts” as an individual entity, such as a sole proprietor with a single buyer or corporate entities with multiple buyers, having purchased at least one part on our marketplace. We define “sellers” as individuals or businesses that have been approved by us to either manufacture a product on our platform for a buyer or have utilized our seller services, including our financial services or the purchase of supplies. Manufacturing is one of the largest industries globally and is in the early stages of digitization. Buyers looking to source manufacturing processes are faced with a highly fragmented and regionalized base of sellers that are prone to supply chain disruptions and are difficult to efficiently manage. Opaque pricing structures, long lead times and a lack of quality controls contribute to a procurement process that is inefficient, unpredictable and unreliable. Conversely, sellers of specialized manufacturing services are faced with limited ability to source customers, inconsistent demand, volatile operating costs and resource constraints that put their businesses under significant financial pressure. For supply chains around the world to become more reliable and resilient, buyers and sellers need a more efficient, agile way to transact. We enable buyers across industries to source a broad array of manufacturing processes to meet their needs. We generate substantially all of our revenue from the prices we charge buyers on our platform. Buyers begin by uploading an engineering schematic that contains 3D design specifications, typically a computer-aided design, or a CAD, file. Then, we price transactions through our proprietary, Note: Revenue and net loss figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020.
