General Information,"We are F45 Training, one of the fastest-growing fitness franchisors in the United States based on number of franchises sold in the United States, focused on creating a leading global fitness training and lifestyle brand. We offer consumers functional 45-minute workouts that are effective, fun and community-driven. Our workouts combine elements of high-intensity interval, circuit and functional training to offer consumers what we believe is the world’s best functional training workout. We deliver our workouts primarily through our digitally connected global network of studios, and we have built a differentiated, technology-enabled platform that allows us to create and distribute workouts to our global franchisee base. Our platform enables the rapid scalability of our model and helps to promote the success of our franchisees. We offer consumers a continuously evolving fitness program in which virtually no two workouts are ever the same. Our vast and growing library of functional training movements allows us to vary workout programs to keep consumers engaged with fresh content, stay at the forefront of consumer trends and drive maximum individual results, while helping our members achieve their fitness goals. We were founded in 2013 in Sydney, Australia. Our CEO and co-founder Adam Gilchrist recognized an opportunity to leverage technology to offer consumers an effective, multi-disciplinary and community-driven workout that serves as an affordable alternative to one-on-one personal training and repetitive, single-discipline studio classes. Soon after the first F45 Training studio opened in Paddington, Australia, our founders focused on using technology to streamline and standardize the F45 Training experience in order to franchise the business. We quickly expanded, initially selling franchises to members of the original studio, after which viral word-of-mouth marketing led to rapid growth, and we opened nearly 200 studios over the following 30 months. In less than eight years, we have scaled our global footprint to 2,801 Total Franchises sold in 63 countries, including 1,555 Total Studios, of which 1,415 had re-opened following temporary closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic, as of June 30, 2021. In March 2019, a group led by Mark Wahlberg and FOD Capital LLC, or FOD Capital, a family office investment fund, made a strategic minority investment in F45 Training, providing critical branding and marketing capabilities to supplement the strengths of our management team. We expect that Mr. Wahlberg’s involvement, leveraging his broad celebrity reach (with over 17 million Instagram followers) and well-known affinity for fitness, will continue to be a key differentiator in helping us to continue to drive growth. In addition to Mr. Wahlberg, we have established relationships with Earvin “Magic” Johnson, Jr., David Beckham, Greg Norman, Cindy Crawford and other professional athletes and personalities in order to promote our products. Our in-studio experience utilizes our proprietary technologies: our fitness programming algorithm and our patented technology-enabled delivery platform. Our fitness programming algorithm leverages a rich content database of over 3,900 unique functional training movements to offer new workouts each day. Our content delivery platform allows us to standardize the F45 Training experience across our global footprint and broadcast content, including workout instructions and timing, directly to our in-studio F45TVs and speaker systems. Our in-studio experience is further enhanced by trainers who provide guidance on proper form and movement, as well as motivate our members and foster a positive sense of community. We believe our approach helps to provide a consistent and high-quality fitness experience across our network of studios, keeping members highly engaged and helping them to achieve and sustain their fitness goals.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage microbiome therapeutics company leveraging our Human-First Discovery platform to develop a novel class of orally administered biological drugs. The microbiome consists of trillions of microbes that live symbiotically in and on every human and are essential to our health. When key microbes are lost, the resulting dysbiosis can increase susceptibility to immune disorders, infections, neurological conditions, cancer and other serious diseases. We are developing novel therapeutics designed to deliver missing microbes and their clinically relevant biochemical functions to correct dysbiosis and the diseases that emerge from it. Our Human-First Discovery platform uses reverse translation to identify diseases of dysbiosis and to design microbiome therapeutics that address them. Our lead product candidate, CP101, delivers a complete microbiome and is being developed initially for the treatment of patients with recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection, or CDI. In June 2020, we reported positive topline data from our first of two pivotal trials in recurrent CDI, and we plan to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial, which we refer to as PRISM4, as our second pivotal trial of CP101 for recurrent CDI in mid-2021. Although we need to generate additional data confirming safety and efficacy to support regulatory approval of CP101 for the treatment of recurrent CDI, we believe data from our pivotal, Phase 2 clinical trial with CP101 validates our platform, positioning us to initiate new clinical trials in at least three new indications over the next 18 months, including chronic hepatitis B virus, or HBV, autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, and ulcerative colitis. (**Revenue and net loss figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020.)

General Information,"Our mission is to deliver the most important and complex payments. In an increasingly digital world, getting paid means Flywire. Flywire is a leading global payments enablement and software company. Our next-gen payments platform, proprietary global payment network and vertical-specific software help our clients get paid and help their customers pay with ease—no matter where they are in the world. Our clients rely on us for integrated solutions that are both global and local, combine tailored invoicing with flexible payment options, and deliver highly personalized omni-channel experiences. We believe we make generational advances for our clients by transforming payments into a source of value and growth for their organizations while delighting their customers with payment experiences that are engaging, secure, fast, and transparent. There have been substantial strides made in payments technology in the retail and e-commerce industries; however, massive sectors of our global economy—including education, healthcare, travel, and business-to-business, or B2B, payments—are still in the early stages of digital transformation. We estimate the annual addressable volume for these sectors alone to be approximately $11.7 trillion, as more fully described below in “Our Market Opportunity”. We believe Flywire is well-positioned to capture a meaningful share of this global payment volume given our ability to provide deeply-integrated digital solutions that address both domestic and cross-border payments. Our clients, and the types of organizations we serve in education, healthcare, travel, and B2B, require payment processes and experiences that can deliver high-stakes, high-value payments and are specifically tailored to their industry, their business, and their customers. Often, payment solutions have a “one size fits all” approach, without regard for the particular nuances and detailed operations of specific verticals. Without Flywire, organizations often invest substantial resources in building their own payment offerings or rely on disparate legacy systems, which not only fail to meet their or their customers’ needs but also divert meaningful resources away from revenue-generating work. When core payment capabilities like invoicing, diverse payment offerings and reconciliation are inefficient, organizations miss the opportunity to use payments to scale and grow their business.

General Information,"(Note: This is NOT an IPO. IPOScoop has No Call on this offering. This is an uplift to the NASDAQ from the OTCQB market.) We have developed four fundamental disruptive proprietary technologies which we believe solve the most fundamental problems plaguing the Internet of things (“IoT”) industry by: (1) increasing overall chip integration by shifting it to the device level; (2) creating a faster 5G cellular technology by using Ultra-narrowband technology; (3) leveraging ultra-narrowband power line communication (“PLC”) technology; and (4) User Interface Machine auto generation technology. Our Universal smart technology is designed to overcome instrumentation interoperability and interchangeability. The electronic design starts from a 90% completed common foundation we call our universal smart instrumentation platform (“USIP”), instead of the current method of building each stand-alone instrument from scratch. Our method eliminates redundant hardware and software and results in significant cost savings and production efficiency. We have developed software machine auto generation technology to replace the manual software designs which are currently in use and cannot satisfy the exponential growth of future IoT industry demand. Our ultra-narrowband PLC enables our users to send data over existing electricity power cables and immediately establish a ubiquitous data network without substantial new investment for a dedicated wiring infrastructure. Our ultra-narrow band technology is capable of overcoming the noise problems communicating through power lines that have hindered our competitors for over a century. Our wireless communication technology allows for longer-range coverage, is more energy effective and has much faster data sending speeds than the current 5G technology speeds being used.

General Information,"The chromatin regulatory system orchestrates gene expression–the turning on and off of genes–which is fundamental to how all our cells function. Breakdowns in this system lead to a wide range of diseases impacting millions of patients. Understanding the mechanism of how this system works could lead to an entirely new class of therapeutics. To our knowledge, we are the only company with the ability to study the chromatin regulatory system at scale, in context, and in an integrated way. We are pioneering the discovery and development of a new class of medicines targeting genetically determined dependencies within the chromatin regulatory system, an untapped opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Our proprietary Gene Traffic Control platform gives us an integrated, mechanistic understanding of how the various components of the chromatin regulatory system interact, allowing us to identify, validate and potentially drug targets within the system. Breakdowns in the chromatin regulatory system are associated with over 50 percent of all cancers. Addressing these breakdowns could potentially provide therapies for over 2.5 million patients.

They collectively hold decades of operational experience at Disney. After joining Disney in 1990, Mr. Staggs held a number of key roles, including CFO of Disney; chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and COO of Disney.

General Information,"Forza X1, Inc. aims to be among the first to develop and manufacture electric boats targeting the recreational market. Our mission is to inspire the adoption of sustainable recreational boating by producing stylish electric sport boats. We are focused on the creation and implementation of marine electric vehicle (“EV”) technology to control and power our electric boats utilizing our proprietary outboard electric motor. Our electric boats are being designed as fully integrated electric boats including the hull, outboard motor and control system. To date, we have completed the design of the hull and running surface of the boat and have begun tooling the molds required to build the physical fiberglass boat. We have entered into a supply agreement for the supply of the lithium battery packs that we plan to use to power the electric boats, completed the design and prototyping of the boat control system, and completed the design and are halfway through prototyping of the electric outboard motor. We expect to begin production of our FX1 fully integrated electric boat and motor and commence selling to end user customers by the second quarter of 2023. We believe that the boating industry will follow in the footsteps of the electrification of the automotive industry by creating electric boats that meet or exceed the traditional boating consumers expectations of price, value and run times. In other words, electric boats must offer a similar experience when compared to traditional gas-powered boat in terms of size, capability and price point. We currently are a wholly owned subsidiary of Twin Vee Powercats Co. Prior to our incorporation in October 2021, we operated as the Electra Power Sports™ Division of Twin Vee. With increased indications of interest received by Twin Vee for electric vehicles, Twin Vee determined that we should be a stand-alone entity and transferred the entirety of its electric boat business to us. To date, Forza X1 has received $2 million in capital contributions from Twin Vee. We have used those funds for the design, development, testing, production and marketing of our electric boats and electric outboard motors. Until such time as we receive proceeds from this offering or we generate revenue from the sale of our electric boats, we anticipate that we will continue to receive and rely on funding from Twin Vee. Our initial two models, the FX1 Dual Console and FX1 Center Console, are being designed to be 24-foot in length, have an 8’ beam or width and utilize a catamaran hull surface to reduce drag and increase run times. The initial launch of FX1 will include our proprietary single electric outboard motor. Both FX1 models are being designed with advanced high-powered, liquid-cooled battery packs that will be provided by the third-party supplier with whom we have entered into a five-year supply agreement and a vehicle control unit with proprietary control software all integrated into a 22” master control touch screen that will be used to control most functions of the boat. We have also filed three design and four utility patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office relating to, among other things, our propulsion system being developed and boat design.  We intend to offer our EV products, services and support through a Web-based and mobile phone App that will be vertically integrated and a direct-to-consumer platform.

General Information,"We intend to focus our search on a target (our “Target Business”) with business operations or prospective operations in the technology, digital media, e-commerce, financial technology, or digital services sectors, which we refer to as the “new economy sectors”, across the high growth markets of the Middle East North Africa & Turkey (“MENAT”), Sub-Saharan Africa (“SSA”), South Asia (“SA”) and Southeast Asia (“SEA”) (collectively, our “Target Markets”). (New blank-check company or SPAC incorporated in the Cayman Islands) We believe that our Target Markets benefit from significant macro-economic tail winds. Collectively, these markets represent a fast-growing population of over 4 billion people(1), real GDP of approximately $13 trillion(2), a high proportion of young people with access to internet of who are propelling digital leap across sectors. These markets are at different stages of development of the internet economy eco-system and growing rapidly, in some cases by rolling out models that are already proven in more developed markets (delivery apps, vertical and horizontal e-commerce, media streaming etc.) and in other instances innovative, tailored solutions addressing specific market needs (mobile wallets, alternative finance etc.). Often, global players are unable to provide the degree of localization required to create strong propositions (e.g. Cash on delivery alternatives to address low credit card penetration in some markets). We believe that the new economy sectors are poised for continued rapid growth. Our potential Target Businesses will vary by sub-region: • MENAT: relatively higher incomes (especially in the Gulf Cooperation Council “GCC” countries) and internet access with very low but fast-growing e-commerce penetration (e-commerce as a % of total retail sales is around 5% in the GCC as compared with almost 28% and 14% in the UK and US respectively) is creating opportunities in e-commerce, delivery services, classifieds and internet infrastructure; • Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): In SSA, owing to a significant unbanked population, card and digital payments remain low. This has led to significant growth in mobile wallets, alternative lenders and payment/remittance businesses that represent attractive potential opportunities for us • South Asia: Large population size of around 1.7 billion with about 45% under the age of 25, rapidly rising per capita incomes and urbanization levels, makes South Asia a very attractive market for technology and technology enabled businesses in sectors such as e-commerce, edtech and foodtech. High mobile penetration rates have created opportunities for digital finance services such as mobile wallets, consumer finance and mobile payments for a population that is largely unbanked and underbanked as well as digital media services like streaming and gaming • South East Asia: represents relatively more mature markets with higher income levels and more developed infrastructure. Higher e-commerce spending, significant time spent online by the high proportion of young population. This has led to an explosion of new media and gaming companies alongside more mature e-commerce, internet infrastructure, classifieds and other specialized players (Note: Frontier Investment Corp. priced its SPAC IPO on June 30, 2021, in line with the terms in its prospectus: 20 million units at $10 each to raise $200 million.)",BLANK CHECKS,0,2021,Contact Information,"3411 Silverside Road Tatnall Building #104 Wilmington, DE 19810",(302) 351-3367,,Frontier Investment,Financial Information,$250.0mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$0 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,FICVU,NASDAQ,20.0,$10.00 - $10.00,$200.0 mil,J.P.

General Information,"Note: Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd. is known as China’s “Uber for Trucks,” a digital platform connecting shippers with truckers. The company is offering 82.5 million American Depositary Shares (ADS). Each ADS represents 20 Class A ordinary shares. The IPO of 82.5 million ADS works out to 1.65 billion Class A ordinary shares, according to the prospectus. Full Truck Alliance Co. Ltd. (FTA) filed confidentially for an IPO with the SEC on Feb. 11, 2021. This company is incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Revenue of $395.5 million and a net loss of $531.9 million are for 2020 in U.S. dollars, according to the prospectus. Full Truck Alliance also said it recorded non-GAAP adjusted net income of US$43.1 million in 2020. From the prospectus: Our mission is to make logistics better. We are shaping the future of logistics with technology. Logistics is the lifeblood of our economy, powering the movement of goods and connecting the engines of production and consumption. We aspire to revolutionize logistics, improve efficiency across the value chain and reduce carbon footprint for our planet. Full Truck Alliance, or FTA, is the world’s largest digital freight platform by gross transaction value, or GTV, in 2020, according to the CIC Report. We have transformed China’s road transportation industry by pioneering a digital, standardized and smart logistics infrastructure across the value chain. Our platform connects shippers with truckers to facilitate shipments across distance ranges, cargo weights and types. We have built a vibrant ecosystem of millions of shippers and truckers. In March 2021, approximately 1.4 million shippers posted shipping orders on our platform. In 2020, we facilitated 71.7 million fulfilled orders with GTV of RMB173.8 billion (US$26.6 billion), and over 2.8 million truckers fulfilled shipping orders on our platform. Approximately 20% of all China’s heavy-duty and medium-duty truckers fulfilled shipping orders on our platform in 2020, according to the CIC Report. In the first quarter of 2021, we facilitated 22.1 million fulfilled orders with GTV of RMB51.5 billion (US$7.9 billion), representing 170.2% and 108.0% year-over-year growth, respectively. China has the world’s largest road transportation market with a market size of RMB6.2 trillion (US$951.5 billion) in 2020, according to the CIC Report. The transportation of full-truckload, or FTL, and less-than-truckload, or LTL, shipments, makes up a majority of the road transportation market in China, amounting to RMB5.3 trillion (US$816.7 billion) in 2020 and expected to reach RMB6.5 trillion by 2025, according to the CIC Report. The road transportation industry in China is highly fragmented, complex and inefficient. Road shipments are primarily arranged on-demand, and information is highly asymmetric. There is a high degree of fragmentation among both shippers and truckers, with a large long-tail of shippers who are small and medium-sized enterprises, and truckers who are individual owner-operators. This is structurally different from the U.S., where shippers are concentrated and served by scaled incumbents. In China, the matching of shippers and truckers traditionally took place offline in remote logistics parks, where shipping orders were written on blackboards in a disorganized manner, with most of the negotiation process conducted over the phone or in person. The process typically involved layers of middlemen. Pricing was opaque. Yunmanman and Huochebang were founded in 2013 and 2011, respectively, and both companies rapidly grew to become leading digital freight platforms in China. The two companies merged to create FTA in 2017, establishing a nationwide road logistics network with significant economies of scale.

General Information,"Note: Both Reuters and The Wall Street Journal estimate that FWD Group Holdings’ IPO could raise $2 billion to $3 billion. (FWD Group Holdings is incorporated in the Cayman Islands) Our vision is changing the way people feel about insurance. We are a fast-growing and leading Pan-Asian life insurer with a customer-led, legacy-light and digital-first model.  We were founded in 2013 by our founder, Mr. Richard Li, with the ambition of forging our own path as a next-generation insurer in Asia. We set out to transform insurance with technology to disrupt the traditional mindset, behaviors and operations of the insurance industry. We developed our platform from the early days of our operation with minimal legacy. That advantage, combined with our speed of execution, has allowed us to quickly capture market opportunities and stay ahead of the industry average in terms of certain key performance indicators, such as Annualized Premium Equivalent (“APE”) growth rates in the markets in which we operate. We have built our leadership team and culture to align with this vision.  We have grown from three markets at inception to 10 markets, including Hong Kong (and Macau), Thailand (and Cambodia), Japan, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia. This provides us access to some of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the world with an expanding but underinsured population. Our Southeast Asia markets contributed over 40% of our Value of New Business (“VNB”) in 2020. We achieved 5.5 times growth of our APE in 2020 since our first full year of operations in 2014, growing from US$309 million in 2014 to US$1,692 million in 2020, and our VNB grew 5.0 times over the same period, increasing from US$123 million in 2014 to US$617 million in 2020.  *Note: We recorded total revenue of US$9,487 million (US$9.49 billion) and a net loss of US$252 million in 2020.  **Note: In the chart below, the revenue figure is for the last 12 months that ended June 30, 2021, and the net income figure is the net profit attributable to shareholders for the last 12 months that ended June 30, 2021, according to figures in the prospectus.",Insurance agents & brokers,36100,2013,Contact Information,"13/F, 14 Taikoo Wan Road, Taikoo Shing, Hong Kong SAR",+852 2850 3823,http://www.fwd.com/,FWD GROUP HOLDINGS LIMITED,Financial Information,,$11567.0 mil (last 12 months),$152.0 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,FWD,NYSE,0.0,$0.00 - $0.00,$100.0 mil,Morgan Stanley/ Goldman Sachs (Asia)/ J.P.
