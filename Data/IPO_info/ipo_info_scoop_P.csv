Those institutions must be able to function in times of stability as well as crisis and uncertainty. To do so, they need software that works. We were founded in 2003 and started building software for the intelligence community in the United States to assist in counterterrorism investigations and operations. We later began working with commercial enterprises. We have built two principal software platforms, Palantir Gotham (“Gotham”) and Palantir Foundry (“Foundry”). Gotham, our first software platform, was constructed for analysts at defense and intelligence agencies. They were hunting for needles not in one, but in thousands of haystacks. And they did not have the software they needed to do their jobs. In Afghanistan and Iraq, soldiers were mapping networks of insurgents and makers of roadside bombs by hand. Gotham enables users to identify patterns hidden deep within datasets, ranging from signals (from) intelligence sources to reports from confidential informants, and helps U.S. and allied military personnel find what they are looking for. We later found that the challenges faced by commercial institutions when it came to working with data were fundamentally similar. Companies routinely struggle to manage, let alone make sense of, the data involved in large projects. Foundry was built for them. Our software is used by customers across 36 industries and in more than 150 countries.",PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE,2398,2003,Contact Information,"1555 Blake Street, Suite 250 Denver, Colorado 80202",(720) 358-3679,http://www.palantir.com,Palantir Technologies,Financial Information,,$901.1 mil (last 12 months),$-472.4 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,PLTR,NYSE,257.1,$7.25 - $7.25,$1864.3 mil,None,,9/30/2020,Priced,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers

Our flagship AI-driven product, LiverMultiScan, has been cleared by the FDA for non-invasive diagnosis and monitoring of liver disorders, which may include nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of fatty liver disease. NASH is estimated to affect more than 250 million adults globally and more than 20 million adults in the United States. NAFLD is the most prevalent chronic liver disease, an epidemic affecting as much as 25% of the world’s population and has significant co-morbidities, including diabetes. There are about 90 million NAFLD patients in the United States. Approximately 23% of NAFLD patients eventually develop NASH. MRCP+ is our AI-driven FDA-cleared product for digitalized, enhanced visualization and quantitative analysis of the biliary system driven by advanced image analysis and machine learning, a method of data analysis that automates analytical model building, and, to our knowledge, is the only clinically available tool of its kind.  Hepatica is our AI-driven FDA-cleared product for clinical use to process MR image (MRI) data sets to provide simultaneous evaluation of liver health (fibroinflammation and fat) and volumetry with AI-driven delineation of the liver and individual (Couinaud) segments in a single report of quantitative metrics.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for rare diseases with significant unmet need, initially focused on angioedema and other bradykinin-mediated diseases. Our first molecule, PHA121, is a novel, small molecule bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist for the treatment of hereditary angioedema, or HAE, a rare and potentially fatal disease that can cause swelling of the airways, hands, feet, arms, legs, lips and tongue. Bradykinin-B2-receptor inhibition is a clinically validated mechanism for the treatment of HAE, as demonstrated by icatibant, which is a bradykinin B2-receptor antagonist approved in Europe in 2008 and in the United States in 2011 (as FIRAZYR). We designed PHA121 to improve upon the therapeutic profile of existing therapies and, through oral delivery, to provide patients with quality of life and convenience that is superior to current standard-of-care HAE treatments, which are injectables. We believe PHA121 has the potential to provide a safe, effective and convenient option for both acute and prophylactic treatments of HAE.

General Information,"We are a precision oncology company pioneering the discovery and development of small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies targeting p53 mutations. p53 is a well-defined tumor suppressor protein known as the “guardian of the genome,” and normal, or wild-type, p53 has the ability to eliminate cancer cells. However, mutant p53 proteins can be misfolded and lose their wild-type tumor-suppressing function. These p53 mutations are found in approximately half of all cancers. The field of p53 biology was established by our co-founder, Dr. Arnold Levine, when he discovered the p53 protein in 1979. We have leveraged more than four decades of research experience and developed unique insights into p53 to create a precision oncology platform designed to generate selective, small molecule, tumor-agnostic therapies that structurally correct specific mutant p53 proteins to restore their wild-type function. We are deploying our precision oncology platform to target the top 10 most frequent, or hotspot, p53 mutations that are collectively associated with approximately 10% to 15% of all cancers. We believe that we have designed our lead product candidate, PC14586, to potently and selectively correct p53 misfolding caused by a specific p53 mutation, Y220C, while sparing wild-type p53. The Y220C mutation is associated with 1.0% to 1.5% of all cancers, including breast, non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers.",Pharmaceuticals,39,2013,Contact Information,"8 Clarke Drive, Suite 3 Cranbury, NJ 08512",(609) 642-6670,http://www.pmvpharma.com,PMV Pharmaceuticals,Financial Information,$655.86mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$-40.6 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,PMVP,NASDAQ,11.8,$18.00 - $18.00,$211.7 mil,Goldman Sachs/ BofA Securities/ Cowen/ Evercore ISI,,9/25/2020,Priced,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers

General Information,"We will seek a target in the disruptive technology sector with a spotlight on companies in Asia, with Japan in particular (but expressly not in China or Hong Kong). Japan is home to some of the most well-known companies, particularly in the area of consumer electronics. In recent years, more and more private equity firms are attracted to balance sheets awash with cash in Japan; more than half of Japanese companies have net cash versus 10 percent to 20 percent in western developed markets – and the ability of businesses to increase dividends and share buybacks, which could see greater value ascribed to shares. Japanese stocks are therefore becoming interesting for investors seeking a secure and growing dividend income, and ideally some growth on top. The dividend yield exceeds that of the U.S. market, but on average, Japanese businesses are only paying out a third of profits as dividends, so there is significant room for payouts to grow. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we will focus on Japan and Southeast Asia, but will not consider any target investments in China or Hong Kong. We intend to focus our search for a target business addressing a large market opportunity with a company that is driving its growth through technology. Potential industries that fit this focus are enterprise security and operations applications, cloud-based content and digital streaming services, drone technology and service, AI companies, consumer healthcare and wellness, biomedical technology, entertainment/gaming companies, distance learning, and e-sports companies.

We leverage our proprietary precision medicine platform, Prometheus360™, which includes one of the world’s largest gastrointestinal (GI) bioinformatics databases, to identify novel therapeutic targets and develop therapeutic candidates to engage those targets. In parallel, we are developing companion diagnostic tests designed to identify patients more likely to respond to our therapeutic candidates. We have generated a robust initial pipeline of therapeutic development programs for the treatment of IBD. Our lead product candidate, PRA023, is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has been shown to block the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis that was clinically validated in a third-party Phase 2a clinical trial in ulcerative colitis (UC). PRA023 has the potential to substantially improve outcomes for moderate-to-severe IBD patients who are predisposed to increased TL1A expression. We are developing PRA023 to treat UC and Crohn’s disease (CD). We initiated a Phase 1a clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers in December 2020.

General Information,"We are a preclinical oncology company focused on developing an arsenal of next-generation therapeutics to target difficult-to-treat cancers and improve quality of life for patients. We develop our product candidates with the objective to directly kill tumor cells, and to address the underlying pathologies created by cancer that enable its uncontrollable proliferation and immune evasion. Since our launch in 2019, we have developed a broad portfolio of novel antibody drug conjugate, or ADC, product candidates, and monoclonal antibody, or mAb, preclinical discovery programs that we are developing as monotherapies and in combination with other therapies. We take a holistic view of attacking the key drivers of tumor growth and progression within the tumor microenvironment, or TME, including targeting of tumor antigens and modulating the innate and adaptive immune response. The TME is an immunosuppressive environment consisting of cancer cells and stroma, which includes the blood vessels, immune cells, fibroblasts, signaling molecules, and the extracellular matrix that surrounds the tumor. The TME plays multiple roles in tumor formation, progression and metastasis as well as anti-tumor immune activity. We are developing our ADC and mAb product candidates to precisely target key modulators of the adaptive and innate immune system within the TME for difficult-to-treat solid and hematologic tumors.
