We are focused on the production and development of the Cerro Los Gatos Mine and the further exploration and development of the Los Gatos District in Chihuahua, Mexico. *Note: Sales and net loss figures are for 2019, from the prospectus. The price of silver rallied strongly to multi-year highs in September 2020. As of Sept. 30, 2020, the LBMA silver price has increased 31% compared to the year-end 2019 price. The recent silver price appreciation is believed to have been driven by accommodative monetary policy, aggressive stimulus measures and accelerating investment demand in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as disrupted production and a recovery in industrial consumption. These factors have enhanced silver’s appeal to investors seeking a hedge against inflation, a decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar, and general economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Trading volumes at futures and options exchanges have increased significantly, and exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) inflows have been strong.

We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company engaged in the development of hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies for the treatment of solid tumors. We have developed a novel biologic platform which involves the ex-vivo gene transfer of a therapeutic candidate into autologous hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) to deliver immunomodulatory molecules directly to the tumor by infiltrating monocytes/macrophages (Tie2 Expressing Monocytes – TEMs). Our technology is designed to turn TEMs, which normally have an affinity for and travel to tumors, into a “Trojan Horse” to counteract cancer progression and to prevent tumor relapse. Our technology is not target dependent, and therefore we believe it can be used as a treatment for a broad variety of cancers. Our technology incorporates the use of a lentiviral vector (LVV) that combines a therapeutic transgene sequence, or payload, with our proprietary platform. Our proprietary platform consists of (i) the Tie-2 promoter, that drives transgene sequence transcription specifically in TEMs, and (ii) miRNA-126 target sequences to downregulate transgene expression post-transcription in those cells where the Tie-2 promoter is active and the miRNA-126 is present.

Our portfolio currently includes GH001, our proprietary inhalable 5-MeO-DMT product candidate which is delivered via a vaporization device produced by a third party, and GH002, our proprietary injectable 5-MeO-DMT product candidate. We have completed a Phase 1 healthy volunteer clinical trial, in which administration of GH001 via inhalation was observed to be well tolerated at the investigated single dose levels and in an individualized dosing regimen with intra-subject dose escalation within a single day. GH001 is currently being investigated in the Phase 2 part of an ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trial in patients with TRD. Based on observed clinical activity, we believe that administration of a single dose of GH001 has the potential to induce ultra-rapid remissions as measured by the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, or MADRS, in certain patients.

It was a house without running water, but Dmitriy felt that not having a great collaboration tool was a bigger problem than his daily trip to the communal well.  “In 2012, I discovered GitLab from my home in the Netherlands on a tech news site. I thought that it was natural that a collaboration tool for developers was open source so people could contribute to it. As a Ruby developer, I was impressed by GitLab’s code quality, especially since it absorbed more than 300 contributions in the first year. In 2013, Dmitriy tweeted that he would like to work on GitLab full-time. After reading that tweet, I approached him, and we partnered so he could work on GitLab full-time.

Be local. We have built the world’s leading platform to enable and accelerate global, direct-to-consumer (“D2C”) cross-border e-commerce. (Global-E Online Ltd. is incorporated in Israel.) Our platform was purpose-built for international shoppers to buy seamlessly online and for merchants to sell from, and to, anywhere in the world – in short, to “go global.” At the same time, to “be local” reflects the localization of the shopper’s experience and our effort to make international transactions as seamless as domestic ones. We have more than 440 merchants on our platform. We increase the conversion of international traffic into sales by removing much of the complexity associated with international e-commerce. Our platform provides a mission-critical integrated solution that creates a localized and frictionless shopper experience and is simple to manage, flexible to adjust and smart in its local market insights and best practices. The vast capabilities of our end-to-end platform include interaction with shoppers in their native languages, market-adjusted pricing, payment options tailored to local market preferences, compliance with local consumer regulations and requirements such as customs duties and taxes, shipping services, after-sales support and returns management. These elements are unified under the Global-e platform to enhance the shopper experience and enable merchants to capture the cross-border opportunity. We support local messaging in over 25 languages, purchases in more than 100 currencies by over 150 payment methods and a multitude of competitively priced shipping options. Shoppers enjoy a fully guaranteed landed price quote, which includes shipping costs, import duties and tax charges, as well as post-sale services, including multi-lingual customer service and a managed returns service. The enhanced shopper experience we enable typically results in improved sales conversion of merchants’ international traffic, thereby increasing their cross-border revenues. We have seen merchants experience significant uplift (often exceeding 60%) in international traffic conversion after beginning to use our platform.

We started with a price comparison tool for prescriptions, offering consumers free access to lower prices on their medication. We wanted to help ensure that no parent had to choose between their child’s next meal and their life-saving medication. Today, we believe our expanded platform improves the health and financial well-being of American families by providing easy access to price transparency and affordability solutions for generic and brand medications, affordable and convenient medical provider consultations via telehealth and additional healthcare services and information.

Public offering details from the prospectus: “Each ADS represents 20 ordinary shares of GGL, par value HK$0.01 per share. We expect the public offering price of the ADSs to be based on the between [$ ] and [$ ] per share. The public offering price per ADS will be determined through negotiation between us and the underwriters in the offering and may be at a discount to the current market price of the ADSs on the OTCQX. Currently, these ordinary shares are traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange with the stock number of 6128.HK and ADSs are traded on the OTC Market under the symbol GRFXY. GGL has applied to have the ADSs listed on the NYSE American LLC stock exchange market (“NYSE American”) under the symbol “GRFX.” “ GGL is a holding company with two significant business segments — (1) graphene products and related businesses, including battery storage solutions for clean energy that deliver reliable and cost-competitive power in a safe and environmentally sustainable way for electric vehicles (“EV”) and renewable power producers; and (2) other businesses (a landscape architecture and design business as well as a catering business; the catering business has been largely suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic). We are a leading manufacturer of natural spherical graphite and specialized graphite products that are used primarily in lithium-ion (“Li-ion”) batteries typically for electric vehicles and clean energy storage solutions. Graphene is a one-atom-thick layer of graphite, a commonly found mineral. Graphene is the thinnest and hardest known material with superior electronic and thermal conductivity and light transmission properties that enable a broad range of applications. Our graphene products operations are based in the PRC and are strategically located near the largest accessible supply source of high-quality natural graphite in the world. We currently supply approximately 30 customers in the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including wholesalers, traders and battery manufacturers. The primary customers for our graphene products include manufacturers of automotive batteries, conductive agents, refractory materials for the steel industry, and heat sink materials for precision electronics. We have 23 patents related to our Graphene Products Business in the PRC, including for products, production methods, machinery design, and environmental protection. Our primary graphene products are: **Spherical graphite of D50=10-15µm (“SG”), which is an essential material for the production of anodes for Li-ion batteries used in electric vehicles (“EV”) and grid energy storage; **High-purity graphite (“HPG”), which contains over 99.95% carbon with less than 0.2% moisture. HPG has superior electric and thermal conductivity, resistance to corrosion, and chemical stability. HPG is used in refractory materials and advanced coatings, among other products, and **Micronized graphite (“MG”), which is a by-product of our production process, with outstanding oxidation resistance under high temperature, lubricative, formability, electric and thermal conductivity, and adhesive properties, and it has several applications, including corrosion-resistant coating, lubricants,and other new composite materials. ​ We believe that the market for our graphene products will continue to experience significant growth. Our graphene products’ market is driven primarily by demand for Li-ion batteries that require SG for anode material and for lithium plasma. We believe that a significant driver for Li-ion batteries is their use in EV and in grid-storage applications. According to a 2020 International Energy Agency report, the PRC accounted for 47% of the global EV stock in 2019 at a market penetration rate of approximately 5%. Based on certain industry studies, we believe that the global EV penetration rate for new vehicles in 2050 could be as much as 70%. A typical Li-ion High-Energy (100 Ah) cell of around 3,400g requires over 650g of graphite and each EV contains approximately 70kg of graphite.

We are a medical technology company focused on developing innovative medical devices that have the potential to improve healthcare. Our primary focus is the sales and marketing of our LuViva® Advanced Cervical Scan non-invasive cervical cancer detection device. The underlying technology of LuViva primarily relates to the use of biophotonics for the non-invasive detection of cancers. LuViva is designed to identify cervical cancers and precancers painlessly, non-invasively and at the point of care by scanning the cervix with light, then analyzing the reflected and fluorescent light. LuViva is designed to provide a less invasive and painless alternative to conventional tests for cervical cancer screening and detection. Additionally, LuViva is designed to improve patient well-being not only because it eliminates pain, but also because it is convenient to use and provides rapid results at the point of care. We focus on two primary applications for LuViva: first, as a cancer screening tool in the developing world, where infrastructure to support traditional cancer-screening methods is limited or non-existent, and second, as a triage following traditional screening in the developed world, where a high number of false positive results cause a high rate of unnecessary and ultimately costly follow-up tests. Screening for cervical cancer represents one of the most significant demands on the practice of diagnostic medicine. As cervical cancer is linked to a sexually transmitted disease—the human papillomavirus (HPV)—every woman essentially becomes “at risk” for cervical cancer simply after becoming sexually active. In the developing world, there are approximately 2.0 billion women aged 15 and older who are potentially eligible for screening with LuViva. Guidelines for screening intervals vary across the world, but U.S. guidelines call for screening every three years. Traditionally, the Pap smear screening test, or Pap test, is the primary cervical cancer screening methodology in the developed world. However, in developing countries, cancer screening using Pap tests is expensive and requires infrastructure and skill not currently existing, and not likely to be developed in the near future, in these countries. **Note: Accumulated deficit of $141.9 million as of Sept. 30, 2021. We currently are seeking regulatory approval to market LuViva in the United States but have not yet received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
