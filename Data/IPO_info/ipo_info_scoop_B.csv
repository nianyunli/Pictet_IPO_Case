General Information,"(Note: IPOScoop has NO CALL on this deal. This is a NASDAQ uplisting. This is NOT an IPO, although the prospectus calls the deal an initial public offering of American Depositary Shares (ADS). Each ADS represents 180 ordinary shares. Bionomics Ltd.’s ordinary shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (“ASX”), under the symbol “BNO.”) We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel allosteric ion channel modulators designed to transform the lives of patients suffering from serious central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders with high unmet medical need. Ion channels serve as important mediators of physiological function in the CNS and the modulation of ion channels influences neurotransmission that leads to downstream signaling in the brain. The α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (“ACh”) receptor (“α7 receptor”) is an ion channel that plays an important role in driving emotional responses and cognitive performance. Utilizing our expertise in ion channel biology and translational medicine, we are developing orally active small molecule negative allosteric modulators (“NAMs”) and positive allosteric modulators (“PAMs”) of the α7 receptor to treat anxiety and stressor-related disorders and cognitive dysfunction, respectively. We are advancing our lead product candidate, BNC210, an oral proprietary selective NAM of the α7 receptor, for the acute treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder (“SAD”) and chronic treatment of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (“PTSD”). There remains a significant unmet medical need for the over 22 million patients in the United States alone suffering from SAD and PTSD. Current pharmacological treatments include certain antidepressants and benzodiazepines, and there have been no new FDA-approved therapies in these indications in nearly two decades. These existing treatments have multiple shortcomings, such as a slow onset of action of antidepressants, and significant side effects of both classes of drugs. BNC210 has been observed in our clinical trials to have a fast onset of action and clinical activity without the limiting side effects seen with the current standard of care. We expect to initiate our Phase 2 PREVAIL trial for BNC210 for the acute treatment of SAD by the end of 2021 and currently anticipate reporting topline data by the end of 2022. We have initiated our Phase 2b ATTUNE trial, a randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate BNC210 for the treatment of PTSD, and we expect to report topline data in the first half of 2023. Our expertise and approach have been validated through our June 2014 research collaboration and license agreement with Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck & Co., Inc., for our α7 receptor PAM program, which targets a receptor that has garnered significant attention for treating cognitive deficits. This partnership enables us to maximize the value of our ion channel and chemistry platforms and develop transformative medicines for patients suffering from cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.

General Information,"(Note: This is NOT an IPO. IPOScoop has NO CALL on this offering. This deal is a NASDAQ uplisting from the OTCQB, where the stock had also traded under the symbol “BTCY”.) Biotricity is a leading-edge medical technology company focused on biometric data monitoring solutions. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote monitoring solutions to the medical, healthcare, and consumer markets, with a focus on diagnostic and post-diagnostic solutions for lifestyle and chronic illnesses. We approach the diagnostic side of remote patient monitoring by applying innovation within existing business models where reimbursement is established. We believe this approach reduces the risk associated with traditional medical device development and accelerates the path to revenue. In post-diagnostic markets, we intend to apply medical grade biometrics to enable consumers to self-manage, thereby driving patient compliance and reducing healthcare costs. Our first focus is on the multi-billion-dollar diagnostic mobile cardiac telemetry market, otherwise known as MCT. We developed our FDA-approved Bioflux® MCT technology, comprised of a monitoring device and software components, which we made available to the market under limited release on April 6, 2018, in order to assess, establish and develop sales processes and market dynamics. The fiscal year ended March 30, 2020 marked the Company’s first year of expanded commercialization efforts, focused on sales growth and expansion. We have expanded our sales efforts to 23 states, with the intention to expand further and compete in the broader US market using an insourcing business model. Our technology has a large potential total addressable market, which can include hospitals, clinics and physicians’ offices, as well as independent diagnostic testing facilities (or IDTFs). We believe our solution’s insourcing model, which empowers physicians with state-of-the-art technology and charges technology service fees for its use, has the benefit of a reduced operating overhead for the Company, and enables a more efficient market penetration and distribution strategy. This, when combined with the value of the Company’s solution in the diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmias, enhancement of patient outcomes, improved patient compliance, and the corresponding reduction of healthcare costs, is what we believe is driving growth and increasing revenue.

We intend to pursue a merger with a high-quality company in our target sectors, especially one where our strategic expertise will add value to the target’s businesses post-merger. The continued growth of connected devices and the increased popularity of digital streaming services globally has supercharged the growth and value of entertainment content. Geographically, growth opportunities in emerging markets, especially in China and India are particularly promising. Even more mature markets like North America present a strong opportunity to drive growth by converting ad-supported users into paid streaming subscribers. About Mubadala Capital Mubadala Capital invests across a range of asset classes, including private equity, public equity, and venture capital. Each business employs a fundamentals-driven investment strategy, prioritizing capital preservation and long-term value creation. Mubadala Capital is a differentiated and value-added investor that leverages both the Mubadala network and the relationships embedded within the investment team to source proprietary investment opportunities on a global basis. The firm has a cohesive and tenured investment team led by senior leadership who have worked together for more than twelve years. Mubadala Capital has a long track record of successfully identifying category leaders suitable for investment, especially in media, entertainment, and premium content and services sectors. Representative transactions the firm has consummated in the recent past include EMI Music Publishing (acquired in 2012 and successfully exited in 2018, making Mubadala Capital one of the few institutional investors to successfully structure, purchase, and exit a major music asset in the last decade), Endeavor (acquired in 2014), Reigning Champs (acquired in 2014), Imagine Entertainment (acquired in 2016), YES Network (acquired in 2019), and Looping Group (acquired in 2019). In total, these transactions and others in the media, entertainment, and premium content and services sectors represent more than $1 billion of capital deployed. These investments and many more have helped Mubadala Capital build a unique network of relationships and access to management teams in the industry, which we believe will help facilitate a successful merger with a target.

General Information,"Note: Bumble is a popular online and mobile dating app that turns antiquated gender norms on their heads by letting women make the first move. Over 40 million users go to Bumble and its sibling dating app, Badoo, each month to discover new people and connect with each other. From the prospectus: Bumble was founded because we noticed two different, yet related issues in our society: antiquated gender norms, and a lack of kindness and accountability on the internet. We observed that women were often treated unequally in society, especially in romantic relationships. At the same time, social networks created possibilities for connections, but they were focused on connections with people you already know and lacked guardrails to encourage better behavior online. We created Bumble to change this. The Bumble brand was built with women at the center—where women make the first move. We are rewriting the script on gender norms by building a platform that is designed to be safe and empowering for women, and, in turn, provides a better environment for everyone. We are leveraging innovative technology solutions to create a more inclusive, safe and accountable way to connect online for all users regardless of gender. Our platform enables people to connect and build equitable and healthy relationships on their own terms. Today, Bumble operates two apps, Bumble and Badoo, where over 40 million users come on a monthly basis to discover new people and connect with each other in a safe, secure and empowering environment. (Note: Badoo, known for its mantra, “Date Honestly,” is popular in Europe and Latin America.) Bumble and Badoo are two of the highest-grossing online dating mobile applications globally, as of August 2020, according to Sensor Tower, with Bumble and Badoo ranking among the top five grossing iOS lifestyle apps in 30 and 89 countries, respectively.",PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE,650,2014,Contact Information,"1105 West 41st Street Austin, Texas 78756",(512) 696-1409,http://www.bumble.com,Bumble Inc.,Financial Information,$7961.0mil,$502.9 mil (last 12 months),$-99.5 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,BMBL,NASDAQ,50.0,$43.00 - $43.00,$2150.0 mil,Goldman Sachs/ Citigroup/ Morgan Stanley/ J.P.
