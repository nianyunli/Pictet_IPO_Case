General Information,"U-BX was incorporated on June 30, 2021, in the Cayman Islands. U-BX does not have material operations of its own. We conduct business through the PRC Operating Entities. Since U-BX China’s establishment in 2018, the PRC Operating Entities have focused on providing value-added services using artificial intelligence-driven technology to businesses within the insurance industry, including insurance carriers and brokers. Our PRC Operating Entities’ business primarily consists of providing the following three services/products: i) digital promotion services, ii) risk assessment services, and iii) value-added bundled benefits. We help our institutional clients obtain visibility on various social media platforms and generate our revenue based on consumers’ clicks, views or our clients’ promotion time through those channels. We have also developed a unique algorithm and named it the “Magic Mirror” to calculate payout risks for insurance carriers to underwrite auto insurance coverage. Utilizing our proprietary algorithmic model, we are able to generate individualized risk reports based on the vehicle brand, model, travel area, and vehicle age. In turn, we are able to generate revenue based on the number of assessment reports we provide to the insurance carriers. Lastly, to help major insurance carriers or brokers attract their customers, we sell bundled benefits, including car wash, maintenance plan or parking notification, to these carriers, which they may then pass onto their customers for either low or no cost. In addition to servicing institutional customers, we provide up-to-date insurance-related information to individual consumers through our mini-application embedded in other social media platforms. The information is provided to educate consumers and insurance brokers about the insurance industry, thus helping us build a stronger brand image with the general public. At present, our client base consists of more than 300 city-level property and auto insurance carriers nationwide, in addition to approximately 200,000 insurance brokers that use our products and services to conduct business on a daily basis.

General Information,"We are a biotechnology company dedicated to developing treatments for certain medical conditions. Two of our programs are focused on kidney disease: Renazorb, for treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, and UNI 494, for treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI). Renazorb and UNI 494 were initially developed by, and licensed to us from Spectrum Pharmaceuticals (“Spectrum”) and Sphaera Pharmaceuticals, respectively. Spectrum conducted a Phase 1 clinical trial with Renazorb in 2012 prior to the grant of our license in 2018. Sphaera conceived, and performed initial characterization of, various potential pro-drug linkers, including the initial patent application, and performed some initial physiochemical characterization and preliminary animal pharmacokinetic studies. During 2020, we conducted preclinical studies with UNI 494. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the gradual loss of kidney function that can get worse over time leading to lasting damage. Our initial focus is on developing drugs and getting them approved in the U.S., and then to partner with global biopharmaceutical companies in the rest of the world. According to estimates by The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2019, 37 million adults in the United States have CKD and, of these, about 2 million patients have CKD Stage 3-5, and around 400,000 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have hyperphosphatemia. In the European Union, around 20 million adults have CKD, more than 1 million are CKD Stage 3-5 patients, and about 180,000 patients with ESRD have hyperphosphatemia. The number of patients with ESRD is increasing steadily and is projected to reach between 971,000 and 1.26 million in 2030. AKI is a sudden episode of kidney failure or kidney damage (within the first 90 days of injury). After 90 days, the patient is considered to have progressed into CKD. AKI affects over 2 million U.S. patients and costs the healthcare system over $9 billion per year. AKI kills more than 300,000 patients per year in the U.S. and is caused by multiple etiologies. Our business model is to license technologies and drugs and pursue development, regulatory approval, and commercialization of those products in global markets. Many biotechnology companies utilize similar strategies of in-licensing and then developing and commercializing drugs. We believe, however, that our management team’s broad network, expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry, and successful track record gives us an advantage in identifying and bringing these assets into our company at an attractive price with limited upfront cost. (Note: Unicycive Therapeutics priced its IPO on July 12, 2021, by slightly increasing the number of units to 5 million, up from 4.55 million in the prospectus, at $5 – the low end of its $5-to-$6 range – to raise $25 million. The company cut its IPO on June 30, 2021, to 4.55 million units at $5 to $6 each – down from 6.7 million units at $5.50 to $6.50 each.
