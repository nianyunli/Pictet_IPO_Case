General Information,"(Note: This is a unit IPO. IPOScoop has NO CALL on unit offerings that are not SPACs. From the prospectus: “We have applied to list our common stock and warrants on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbols “EDBL” and “EDBLW,” respectively.”) Edible Garden is a controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”) farming company. We use traditional agricultural growing techniques together with technology to grow fresh, organic food, sustainably and safely while improving traceability. We use the controlled environment of traditional greenhouse structures, such as glass greenhouses, together with hydroponic and vertical greenhouses to sustainably grow organic herbs and lettuces. In our hydroponic greenhouse, we grow plants without soil. Instead of planting one row of lettuce in the ground, by using a vertical greenhouse, we can grow many towers of lettuce in the same area by planting up instead of planting across. Growing these products sustainably means that we avoid depleting natural resources in order to maintain an ecological balance, such as by renewing, reusing and recycling materials in order to lower the overall one-time use of materials. Our controlled greenhouse facilities allow us to grow consistent quality herbs and lettuces year-round, first by eliminating some of the variability of outdoor farming with our CEA techniques, and second by leveraging our proprietary software, GreenThumb. In addition to using hydroponic and vertical greenhouse systems, we use a “closed loop” system in our greenhouses. Generally, in a “closed loop” system, drain water is recollected and reused for irrigation. In our closed loop system, we also cycle water back into the system that has been collected through reverse osmosis. When compared to conventional agriculture, our closed looped systems and hydroponic methods use less land, less energy and less water (than legacy farms), thus conserving some of the planet’s limited natural resources. Our advanced systems are also designed to help mitigate contamination from harmful pathogens, including salmonella, e-coli and others. We have also developed patented software called GreenThumb that assists in tracking plants through our supply chain. Utilizing our GreenThumb software to track the status of our plants as they grow and move throughout the greenhouse allows us to add a layer of quality control due to the frequent monitoring of the growing process, leading to improved traceability. In this context, traceability means being able to track a plant through all stages of production and distribution.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing a pipeline of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. For therapies designed to engage the immune system to treat disease, it is critical to target activation at the unique location where adaptive immune responses are generated. Our proprietary Amphiphile, or AMP, platform delivers immunotherapeutics directly to the “brain center” of the immune system – the lymph nodes. We believe this site-specific delivery of disease-specific antigens, adjuvants and other immunomodulators will more efficiently educate, activate, and amplify critical immune cells, resulting in induction and persistence of potent adaptive immunity required to treat many diseases. In preclinical models, we have observed lymph-node specific engagement driving therapeutic immune responses of increased magnitude, function and durability. We believe our AMP lymph node targeted approach will produce superior clinical benefits compared to immunotherapies that do not engage the lymph nodes. Our lead product candidate, ELI-002, is being developed to treat cancers driven by KRAS, a mutation found in approximately 25% of tumors.

Endeavor is a premium intellectual property, content, events, and experiences company. We own and operate premium sports properties, including the UFC, produce and distribute sports and entertainment content, own and manage exclusive live events and experiences, and represent top sports and entertainment talent, as well as blue-chip corporate clients. Founded as a client representation business, we expanded organically and through strategic mergers and acquisitions, investing in new capabilities, including sports operations and advisory, events and experiences management, media production and distribution, brand licensing, and experiential marketing. The addition of these new capabilities and insights transformed our business into an integrated global platform anchored by owned and managed premium intellectual property. We believe that our unique business model gives us a competitive advantage in the industries in which we operate. Our direct ownership of scarce sports properties positions us to directly benefit from the generally rising value of sports assets, while giving us direct control to make decisions that sustain the long-term value of our properties. Our dual role as an intellectual property owner and as a trusted advisor to clients and rights holders allows us to make connections across our platform, increasing the earnings of our clients and the value of our sports and entertainment properties. We possess category leading capabilities in various industries, each of which contributes to our financial success. After we founded Endeavor in 1995, we gained scale in representation by merging with the venerable William Morris Agency to form WME in 2009, which was followed by our acquisition of IMG in 2014, adding marketing and licensing, events, media production and distribution, and the sports training institution, IMG Academy. The acquisition of a controlling interest in the UFC in 2016 served as a major step forward in the transformation of our business.

General Information,"At Erasca, our name is our mission: to erase cancer. We are a clinical-stage precision oncology company singularly focused on discovering, developing, and commercializing therapies for patients with RAS/MAPK pathway-driven cancers. Molecular alterations in RAS, the most frequently mutated oncogene, and the MAPK pathway, one of the most frequently altered signaling pathways in cancer, account for approximately 5.5 million new cases of cancer worldwide per year. Our company was co-founded by leading pioneers in precision oncology and RAS targeting to create novel therapies and combination regimens designed to comprehensively shut down the RAS/MAPK pathway for the treatment of cancer. We have assembled what we believe to be the deepest, wholly-owned or controlled RAS/MAPK pathway-focused pipeline in the industry, comprising 11 modality-agnostic programs aligned with our three therapeutic strategies of: (1) targeting key upstream and downstream signaling nodes in the RAS/MAPK pathway; (2) targeting RAS directly; and (3) targeting escape routes that emerge in response to treatment. The target breadth and molecular diversity represented in our pipeline enable us to pursue a systematic, data-driven clinical development effort to identify single agent and combination approaches with the goal of prolonging survival in a wide range of patient populations with high unmet needs. Our modality-agnostic approach aims to allow us to selectively and potently inhibit or degrade critical signaling nodes with small molecule therapeutics, large molecule therapeutics, and protein degraders. Our purpose-built pipeline includes two clinical-stage programs (ERK and SHP2 inhibitors, which together comprise our first, innovative MAPKlamp), two preclinical-stage programs (CNS-penetrant KRAS G12C and EGFR inhibitors), and seven discovery-stage programs targeting other key oncogenic drivers. We expect to have four product candidates in the clinic within the next six quarters, plus an additional IND filing every 12-18 months over the next five years. We believe our world-class team’s capabilities and experience, further guided by our scientific advisory board, which includes the world’s leading experts in the RAS/MAPK pathway, uniquely position us to achieve our bold mission of erasing cancer.

(Incorporated in Nevada) Our product offerings include Expion360’s VPR 4EVER product line, launched in December 2020 and manufactured for the RV/Marine industry, and the e360 Home Energy Storage system, which we are developing to provide a cost-effective and do-it-yourself (“DIY”) flexible system for those looking to power their homes via solar energy, wind or grid back-up. The VPR 4EVER product line, through its rapid sales growth, has shown to be a preferred conversion solution for lead-acid batteries. We believe that our e360 Home Energy Storage system has strong revenue potential with recurring income opportunities for us and our associated sales partners. We currently have over 175 customers, including dealers, wholesalers, and original equipment manufacturers who are driving revenue and brand awareness nationally. Our corporate headquarters are in Redmond, Oregon, with assembly in the United States and suppliers based in Asia. We are in the process of building out manufacturing capacity at our corporate headquarters. Our long-term target is to onshore the manufacturing of most of our components and assemblies, including cell manufacturing, to the United States. The trend of vehicle electrification is expected to be a significant growth catalyst for lithium compounds over the next decade and beyond. The market for lithium-ion batteries is expected to grow at 12.3% CAGR between 2021 and 2030 from roughly $41.1 billion to $116.6 billion, according to a report by Markets and Markets. The vast expansion of the lithium battery market can be attributed to global trends promoting clean energy, as well as the compact and flexible nature of lithium battery packs, which make them easy to install in RV’s and boats. Our technology, which we believe offers industry-leading battery pack flexibility for the most efficient energy storage, is poised to be able to offer power to these large vehicles such as RV’s and recreational boats. **Note: Revenue and net loss figures are for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021.

We are an artificial intelligence-driven pharmatech company committed to discovering, designing and developing the best possible drugs in the fastest and most effective manner. Our goal is to change the pharmaceutical industry’s underlying pharmacoeconomic model, what we call “Shifting the Curve,” by improving the probability of success, time and cost involved with creating new medicines. Our drug candidate pipeline is focused on oncology, including specific deep tumors, as well as on inflammatory diseases, OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and Alzheimer’s disease psychosis. This drug pipeline includes drug candidates that we wholly own and drug candidates that are being developed by our collaboration partner. Our pipeline demonstrates our ability to rapidly translate scientific concepts into precision-designed therapeutic candidates. We have built a complete end-to-end solution of artificial intelligence, or AI, and experimental technologies for target identification, drug candidate design, translational models and patient selection. Our platform has enabled us to design candidate drug molecules that have progressed into clinical trials as well as to provide patients with potentially more applicable drug therapies through AI-guided assessment. ​ We originated the first three AI-designed precision drug candidates to enter human clinical trials. Among these is our most advanced internally developed drug candidate, EXS21546. We began the first Phase 1 clinical trial of this drug candidate in December 2020 and currently expect to report topline data from this trial by the end of 2022. The other two drug candidates, also currently in Phase 1 clinical trials, are being developed by our collaboration partner, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd., or Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, which has sole economic rights to these drug candidates. We have designed four additional drug candidates currently undergoing advanced profiling for submission of investigational new drug, or IND, applications and have more than 25 active projects in total. Although we and our collaboration partners have to date not received regulatory approval for any of our drug candidates, we believe that the quality of our molecules has been demonstrated by the partnership expansions and product-licensing arrangements we have entered into with our collaborators, including Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi S.A., Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, EQRx, Inc. and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (aka the Gates Foundation).
