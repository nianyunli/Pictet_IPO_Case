The official pricing of the IPO was postponed to Wednesday night, April 21, from its original timing on Tuesday, April 20, after the company said in SEC filings that it had received an inquiry from the Commission on Foreign Investment in the U.S.) We are a commercial-stage medical device company focused on transforming the lives of people suffering from epilepsy by reducing or eliminating the occurrence of debilitating seizures. Our novel and differentiated RNS System is the first and only commercially available brain-responsive neuromodulation system that delivers personalized real-time treatment at the seizure source. By continuously monitoring the brain’s electrical activity, recognizing patient-specific abnormal electrical patterns, and responding in real time with imperceptible electrical pulses to prevent seizures, our RNS System is programmed by clinicians to deliver the precise amount of therapy when and where it is needed and provides exceptional clinical outcomes with approximately three minutes of stimulation on average per day. Our RNS System is also the only commercially available device that records continuous brain activity data and allows clinicians to monitor patients not only in person, but also remotely, providing them the data they need to make more informed treatment decisions, thus optimizing patient care. We believe the therapeutic advantages of our RNS System, combined with the insights obtained from our extensive brain data set, offer a significant leap forward in epilepsy treatment.  As of Dec. 31, 2020, over 3,000 patients have received our RNS System. We believe our compelling body of long-term clinical data, demonstrating continuous improvement in outcomes over time, will support the continued adoption of our RNS System among the approximately 575,000 adults in the United States with drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Over time, we plan to seek indication expansion more broadly for use across the entire population of about 1.2 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients in the United States; we may seek to expand our operations to reach the approximately 16.5 million drug-resistant epilepsy patients globally.",SURGICAL & MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS & APPARATUS,152,1997,Contact Information,"455 N.

After the IPO, the stock is expected to trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol “NRSN” and the warrants are expected to trade on the NASDAQ under the symbol “NRSNW”.) (Incorporated in Israel) Our goal is to develop therapeutics to defeat neurodegenerative diseases. We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing treatments for patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. We believe that these diseases, which include Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, among others, represent one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with limited effective therapeutic options available for patients. The burden of these diseases on both patients and society is substantial. For example, the average annual cost of ALS alone is $180,000 per patient, and its estimated annual burden on the U.S. healthcare system is greater than $1 billion. Due to the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases, our strategy is to develop combined therapies targeting multiple pathways associated with these diseases. Our lead product candidate, PrimeC, is a novel extended-release, or ER, oral formulation of a fixed dose combination of two generic FDA-approved drugs, ciprofloxacin and celecoxib, combined in a specific ratio. Ciprofloxacin was approved to treat or prevent a variety of bacterial infections and celecoxib was approved as a prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain. PrimeC is designed to treat ALS by regulating microRNA, or miRNA, synthesis, influencing iron accumulation and reducing neuroinflammation, all of which are hallmarks of ALS pathologies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, have both granted PrimeC an orphan drug designation for the treatment of ALS. We believe PrimeC’s multifactorial mechanism of action has the potential to significantly prolong lifespan and improve ALS patients’ quality of life, thereby reducing the burden of this debilitating disease on both patients and healthcare systems. In addition to PrimeC, we recently initiated research and development efforts in Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, with a similar strategy of combined products.

General Information,"NEXGEL is a leading provider of ultra-gentle high-water-content hydrogels for healthcare and consumer applications. We have developed and manufactured electron-beam cross-linked hydrogels for over two decades. Alongside our strategic partners, NEXGEL has formulated more than 200 different combinations to bring natural ingredients to gentle skin patches that can be worn for long periods of time with little to no irritation. We specialize in custom polymer hydrogels used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We have historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products and have recently began producing our own consumer products using our gels focused on proprietary branded products and white label opportunities. Both our gels and our consumer products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate (a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance) and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in the selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, we and our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture. (Note: NexGel slightly upsized its IPO – a unit offering – at pricing on Dec. 21, 2021, by increasing the number of units to 2.585 million, up from about 2.066 million units in the prospectus, and pricing the units at $5.50 each, down from $6.83, the assumed IPO price in its SEC filing, to raise $14.22 million.

We focus our discovery efforts on small molecule inhibitors of kinases, a class of cellular targets that can play a central role in cancer growth and proliferation. By prioritizing target selectivity, we believe our drug candidates have the potential to overcome resistance, minimize adverse events, optimize brain penetrance to address brain metastases, and drive more durable responses.

All of our programs are currently preclinical, and we plan to initiate our first clinical trial in the second half of 2021. Our first lead product candidate, NVL-520, is a brain-penetrant ROS1-selective inhibitor, designed to inhibit ROS1 fusions that express the normal ROS1 kinase domain without any drug-resistant mutations (“wild-type ROS1”) and also remain active in the presence of mutations conferring resistance to approved and investigational ROS1 inhibitors.

General Information,"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative precision medicines for the treatment of serious unmet medical needs in oncology. We are currently developing two preclinical drug candidates with the lead candidate expected to begin a Phase 1 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2021. NXP800, one of our lead preclinical drug candidates, is an oral small molecule inhibitor of the Heat Shock Factor 1 (HSF1) pathway. The HSF1 signaling pathway plays an important role in the initiation and progression of many cancers. Our initial target indications for NXP800, advanced ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) and relapse/refractory endometrioid ovarian cancer, are both serious conditions of unmet medical need. NXP900, our other lead preclinical drug candidate, is an oral small molecule SRC/YES1 kinase inhibitor. SRC is aberrantly activated in many cancer types, including solid tumors such as breast, colon, prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, while remaining predominantly inactive in non-cancerous cells. SRC overactivation is generally associated with late-stage cancers, metastatic potential and resistance to therapies and poor clinical prognosis. NXP900 has demonstrated potent and selective target inhibition in vitro, and substantial tumor growth inhibition in relevant xenograft models. We plan to continue to advance NXP900 through the preclinical development stages to enable a first-in-human clinical study. *Note: The net loss figure is for the nine months that ended Sept. 30, 2021.
