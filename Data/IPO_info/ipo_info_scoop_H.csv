General Information,"In 2016. we became the holding company for Hanover Community Bank (“the Bank”), a New York-chartered community commercial bank. The Bank was originally organized in 2009, with a focus on serving the South Asian community in Nassau County. After incurring financial and regulatory setbacks, the Bank was recapitalized in 2012 by a group led by our current Chairman and CEO Michael Puorro and current members of our Board of Directors. Following the 2012 recapitalization and hiring of Michael Puorro, the Bank adopted a strategic plan focused on providing differentiated consumer and commercial banking services to clients in the western Long Island markets and New York City boroughs, particularly the Queens and Brooklyn markets. As a result, the Bank has grown its balance sheet significantly both through organic loan and deposit growth, as well as opportunistic acquisitions.  The Bank’s management team members have used their strong local community ties along with their experience with both federal and New York bank regulatory agencies to create a bank that we believe emphasizes strong credit quality, a solid balance sheet without the burden of the troubled legacy assets of other banks, and a robust capital base. Our acquisitions of Chinatown Federal Savings Bank (“CFSB”) in 2019 and Savoy Bank (“Savoy”) in 2021 were significant steps towards accomplishing our objectives of diversifying our niche lending activities and enhancing our funding channels. Our corporate administrative office is located in Mineola, New York, where the Bank also operates a full-service branch office. Additional branches are located in Garden City Park, Forest Hills, Flushing, Sunset Park, Manhattan and Chinatown, New York. We also have an administrative office in Hauppauge, Suffolk County, New York, which helps service our municipal deposit customers. We are in the process of opening a branch office in Freehold, New Jersey. **Note: “Our assets have grown from $68.5 million at Dec. 31, 2012, to $1.46 billion at Dec. 31, 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate in excess of 40%.” As of Dec. 31, 2021, we had total assets of $1.5 billion, total deposits of $1.2 billion, and total stockholders’ equity of $129.4 million. During the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Savoy, which increased our total assets by approximately $650 million and expanded our SBA lending, commercial and consumer loan products. This acquisition was a core driver of growth in our key performance indicators and our financial results. **Note: Revenue and net income figures in this profile are for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2021, according to the prospectus.  **Note: The S-1 filing is dated Feb. 23, 2022, and does not contain terms for the IPO’s size.

The economic collapse caused by the COVID crisis beginning in early 2020 has significantly increased the universe of companies that are either stressed or were forced to restructure their balance sheets through an in-court or out-of-court process.

At hear.com, we are on a mission to bring high quality hearing care to anyone, anywhere. Since our founding in 2012, we have grown rapidly to become the largest online provider of expert, medical-grade hearing care globally.

Both the stock and the warrants will trade on the NASDAQ.) We are a medical technology company primarily focusing on telemedicine solutions that enable the detection and monitoring of cardiac disease outside a healthcare facility setting. Our aim is to deliver innovative, remote diagnostic and monitoring technologies that can be used for patients anywhere, with initial offerings for ambulatory and emergency room use. Our products require FDA clearance and have not been cleared for marketing. We believe our products and services will benefit many stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and healthcare payors. Our initial focus is providing diagnostic data to help physicians with care management of patients with cardiovascular disease. There are two major markets for our initial products: remote patient monitoring and the hospital Emergency Room (ER). First, we are developing our telehealth product to address the rapidly growing field of remote patient monitoring. Our telehealth product is comprised of a credit card-sized ECG machine and a powerful cloud-based diagnostic software expert system. We believe that we are uniquely positioned to play a central role in remote monitoring of high-risk coronary artery disease patients, because the studies performed so far have shown that our ischemia detection system is highly accurate. Our powerful ischemia detection system is unlike other ambulatory cardiac monitors currently on the market which focus on arrhythmia detection. Secondly, we are applying our platform technology to create a software tool for detecting heart attacks in the ER environment. This software tool is designed to enable emergency physicians to more accurately and quickly diagnose heart attacks than currently available. Market release of this Product will precede that of the telehealth Product. To date, we have developed working prototypes for both our telehealth product and our ER product. The ER Product is currently undergoing additional engineering work that we believe will make it ready for FDA 510(k) clearance submission. Our focus over next 18 months will be on getting FDA clearances for both of our products and introducing our first Products to the market. We are partnering with Ximedica, a leading medical device design and manufacturing firm, to finalize the development of our initial products to meet all FDA requirements for the 510(k) submission.

General Information,"We intend to focus on high-growth U.S. and international acquisition targets in the FinTech and Embedded Finance sectors “Embedded Finance” refers to the combination of a non-financial service provider with a financial technology. Embedded Finance offers transformational opportunities among consumer or enterprise businesses that can rapidly monetize and scale through the integration of financial technology. There are a vast range of opportunities. As described by Finextra Research and other sources, examples include: an e-commerce site offering a “buy now, pay later” option that serves as a digital loan; a ride-hailing site allowing users to pay directly on the app, rather than handing the driver cash or a credit card; an auto manufacturer or retailer electronically incorporating the application for insurance into the process of buying the vehicle; a consumer service provider allowing employees to receive payment almost instantly through a digital wallet or special debit cards; a health care provider leveraging data sets to match patients with the optimal coverage; and, a real estate service closing a transaction online without an agent as an intermediary. The potential market for Fintech is large and rapidly expanding, particularly as payments and other embedded finance capabilities have a highly accretive impact on a myriad of consumer and enterprise applications. According to Pitchbook, during 2020, Fintech companies raised over $44 billion from venture capital in over 2,000 deals, with strong momentum in the fourth quarter, and the value of venture capital exits for Fintech companies reached almost $31 billion.

General Information,"Our mission is to revolutionize the real estate transaction through technology, scale and service. By positioning ourselves at the center of the real estate process, we have created an ecosystem that empowers brokerages, franchisees, agents and consumers to conduct real estate transactions in a smarter and more efficient way. HomeSmart is a revolutionary real estate enterprise powered by our proprietary end-to-end technology platform. We provide integrated real estate solutions to agents, brokerages, franchisees and, ultimately, the consumer. Our cloud-based platform empowers our users to succeed by providing a full suite of technology offerings covering nearly every aspect of the real estate transaction. The drive towards a seamless home buying and selling experience is the catalyst for our growth. Technology and automation are at the core of our DNA—grounded in fiscal responsibility and operational excellence. We have been developing our software in-house over the last 20 years and have a 100% adoption rate across our agents. All of our franchisees and agents are automatically added as users and all transactions are processed through our technology platform. Our technology platform is focused on scalability and automation to drive transaction velocity, volume, and operating leverage for our brokers, franchisees, agents and consumers. Our business model has fueled our expansion, and we have over 23,000 agents across 194 offices in 47 states. According to RISMedia, HomeSmart was ranked in the top five residential real estate brokerages by number of transaction sides in the United States in 2020. The market for residential real estate transactions and home-related services is highly fragmented, local and complex. Real estate agents generally operate in local markets as independent contractors and typically move from brokerage to brokerage, across disparate external systems and databases, and use a multitude of services to close a single transaction. To use these services, agents are charged numerous fees and are subject to high commission splits, which may ultimately get passed on to the consumer. Operating profitability of agents is further reduced by ongoing competitive dynamics that allow consumers to push agents for lower commissions on transactions. According to the National Association of REALTORS® (“NAR”), 75% of all agents in the United States are being charged traditional commission splits by their brokerage that typically range from 16% to 39% and can be more, demonstrating there is a clear void in cost-effective and scalable solutions available to agents. We have built a cost-effective, agent-centric real estate business model powered by our cloud-based, end-to-end platform for the residential real estate transaction. Our business model and platform empower brokers, franchisees and agents to provide a seamless transaction process for consumers, while offering a flat transaction fee for franchisees and agents. Our RealSmart technology suite includes RealSmart Broker—brokerage and agent management; RealSmart Agent—business and transaction management; and RealSmart Client—buying and selling transaction management; through which franchisees, agents and consumers are connected in order to conduct all aspects of the real estate process. We believe our technology delivers a full end-to-end experience for the consumer, including virtual tours, marketing, document management, process (sale, purchase, mortgage, title and escrow) tracking, education and training, listing management and more. Additionally, our RealSmart platform allows data to be aggregated for accurate insights, decision making, real-time reporting, business management and transparency for the consumer.

As a holding company with no material operations of our own, we conduct our operations in China through a series of agreements dated April 12, 2021 (the “Contractual Arrangements”), with a variable interest entity, or “VIE”, Shandong Hongli Special Section Tube Co., Ltd., and its subsidiaries, or collectively, “the PRC operating entities”, and this structure involves unique risks to investors. Neither we nor our subsidiaries own any equity interests in the PRC operating entities under the VIE structure.” The PRC operating entities are one of the leading cold roll formed steel profile manufacturers in China with respect to function innovation, performance improvement, and customized manufacturing of the products, according to the China Sub-Association for Cold Formed Steel Industries, a professional industrial association. A profile is a specific product designed for a specific use. The PRC operating entities design, customize and manufacture cold roll formed steel profiles for machinery and equipment in a variety of sectors, including but not limited to mining and excavation, construction, agriculture and transportation. With more than a 20-year operating history, the PRC operating entities have developed customers in more than 30 cities in China and a global network covering South Korea, Japan, the U.S., and Sweden. The customers of the PRC operating entities include large corporations and international enterprises such as Weichai LOVOL Heavy Industry Co. Ltd. (“LOVOL”), SUNGJIN TECH CO., LTD (“South Korean VOLVO”), Shandong Lingong Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. (“SDLG”), and some new customers associated with Katsushiro Machinery Co., Ltd. (“Japan Katsushiro”). Most of the customers have been with the PRC operating entities for an average of 10 years. Most of the main customers of the PRC operating entities increased orders with the PRC operating entities during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 and for the six months ended June 30, 2021, and based on their new contracts with the PRC operating entities, they will continue to increase their orders in the next 2-3 years. The PRC operating entities employ a broad array of manufacturing techniques, most importantly cold roll forming (“CRF”) which is the technique used for manufacturing all their products that differentiates the PRC operating entities from other steel pipe manufacturers that employ alternative forming techniques such as extrusion or pull-trusion. CRF is widely used for applications where precise dimension and mechanical tolerances are required.",Custom steel products - manufacturing,,1999,Contact Information,"Beisanli Street, Economic Development Zone Changle County, Weifang Shandong, China 262400",+86 0536-2185222,,Hongli Group Inc.,Financial Information,$115.0mil,$16.57 mil (last 12 months),$3.03 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,HLP,NASDAQ,5.0,$4.00 - $6.00,$25.0 mil,EF Hutton,-,,TBA,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,
