General Information,"We are leading a revolution in measurement devices for chemical and biochemical analysis. We are democratizing laboratory mass spectrometry instruments with our simple handheld and desktop devices, addressing critical-to-life applications. We are reimagining where Mass Spec technology can be used if it is sufficiently small in size, low in cost, and simple to operate. We have developed an innovative suite of purpose-built handheld and desktop mass spectrometry, or Mass Spec, devices for the point-of-need. Leveraging our proprietary platform technology, we make the extraordinary analytical power of Mass Spec available in devices that are significantly smaller and more accessible than conventional laboratory instruments. Our Mass Spec devices are used at the point-of-need to interrogate unknown and invisible materials and provide quick, actionable answers to directly address some of the most critical problems in life sciences research, bioprocessing, industrial biotech, forensics and adjacent markets.
