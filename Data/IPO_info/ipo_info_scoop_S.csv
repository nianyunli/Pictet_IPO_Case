General Information,"(Note: Sagimet Biosciences Inc. withdrew its IPO plans in an SEC filing dated March 21, 2022. The company filed its S-1 on April 16, 2021, and an S-1/A on May 10, 2021, but no terms were filed.) We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a portfolio of internally discovered, selective fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitors for the treatment of several diseases that result from the overproduction of the fatty acid, palmitate. Based on our clinical and preclinical data, we believe that our wholly owned pipeline of oral FASN inhibitors has the potential to offer treatments for indications in several therapeutic areas of high unmet medical need including liver diseases and cancers. TVB-2640, which we are developing as an oral, once-daily pill, is our lead drug candidate that we selected from more than 1,200 compounds in our library of FASN inhibitors and has been studied in over 260 subjects, including healthy volunteers and patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) or cancer. In our FASCINATE-1 Phase 2a clinical trial, TVB-2640 demonstrated statistically significant improvements across steatosis, inflammation/lipotoxicity, fibrosis and metabolic biomarkers important in NASH, and was well-tolerated. We believe that these attributes provide TVB-2640 the potential to treat a broad range of patients in this multifactorial disease. In the second quarter of 2021, we plan to initiate enrollment of our FASCINATE-2 Phase 2b clinical trial in NASH patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis to evaluate the impact of TVB-2640 on disease improvement by assessing liver biopsies after 52 weeks of treatment. We also plan to conduct an interim analysis after a portion of the patients complete 26 weeks of treatment. Within oncology, in the second half of 2021, we plan to initiate a randomized, controlled Phase 2 clinical trial for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and a Phase 1b/2 basket clinical trial in several solid tumors where FASN inhibition may have promising utility. In addition, we plan to advance our second FASN inhibitor, TVB-3567, into a first-in-human clinical trial in the second half of 2021. In healthy adults, FASN is a key enzyme involved in the production of saturated fatty acids in the liver and other organs and is the only enzyme in the human body capable of converting metabolized sugars into palmitate. Palmitate is a saturated fatty acid that serves as a building block for longer chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids and can directly interact with other proteins to sustain normal cell signaling and metabolic function. The overproduction of palmitate is a critical driver of cellular metabolic dysfunction that can drive development or progression of several different diseases. In patients with NASH, increased FASN-mediated palmitate synthesis in the liver is the source of three key drivers of the disease: excess accumulation of liver fat, inflammation and fibrosis. If left untreated, these can lead to cirrhosis of the liver, liver cancer and/or liver transplantation. **Note: “Our net loss was $11.4 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020, and (our net loss was) $5.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, respectively.

General Information,"We are a specialty medical device company dedicated to bringing vision and freedom back to patients suffering from late-stage conditions of the retina. We are engaged in the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of proprietary ophthalmic devices and technologies that are intended to significantly improve the vision and quality of life of individuals with untreatable retinal disorders, particularly Age-Related Macular Degeneration (“AMD”). Our team is passionately developing a solution for patients in this underserved group. There are more than 11 million people living today with blindness from AMD. This group not only suffers from loss of vision, but also a significant loss of social function and the depression that goes along with it. Our current product line consists of our first-generation implantable miniature telescope (“IMT”), which we refer to as WA IMT; our Smaller-Incision, New Generation (SING) IMT, which we refer to as SING IMT; and our Tsert delivery system. Our WA IMT is the first implantable medical device approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) that works similarly to the telephoto lens of a camera, which enables improvement in vision and quality of life for individuals with the most advanced form of AMD, commonly referred to as late-stage AMD. It is important to note that not every patient with late-stage AMD is a candidate for treatment using our WA IMT.

General Information,"Samsara is on a mission to increase the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the operations that power the global economy. To realize this vision, we pioneered the Connected Operations Cloud, which allows businesses that depend on physical operations to harness Internet of Things (IoT) data to develop actionable business insights and improve their operations. Businesses in industries like transportation, wholesale and retail trade, construction, field services, logistics, utilities and energy, government, healthcare and education, manufacturing, food and beverage, and others are the backbone of the global economy. They operate high-value assets, coordinate large field workforces, manage complex logistics and distributed sites, and face environmental, safety and other regulatory requirements. We estimate that these industries represented over 40% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020. Yet historically, these industries have been underserved by technology, leaving them heavily reliant on manual processes and legacy systems that are siloed and lack cloud connectivity. Without connected digital tools, physical operations businesses struggle to access real-time data, making it nearly impossible to achieve complete operational visibility or drive meaningful improvements in productivity. We are solving the problem of opaque operations and disconnected systems. By harnessing recent advancements in IoT connectivity, artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing and video imagery, we are enabling the digital transformation of physical operations. Using our Connected Operations Cloud, customers can visualize their physical operations in real-time, on one integrated platform in a way that would have been impossible and impractical only a few years ago. Our Connected Operations Cloud consolidates data from our IoT devices and a growing ecosystem of connected assets and third-party systems, and makes it easy for organizations to access, analyze and act on data insights, using our cloud dashboard, custom alerts and reports, mobile apps and workflows. Our differentiated, purpose-built suite of solutions enables organizations to embrace and deploy a digital, cloud-connected strategy across their operations. With Samsara, customers have the ability to drive safer operations, increase business efficiency, and achieve their sustainability goals, all to improve the lives of their employees and the customers they serve.

General Information,"Since 2017, we have focused on the residential property rental industry in China. We leased residential properties from individual property owners on a long-term basis, renovated and furnished such properties in a clean and modern manner, and rented them out to individual tenants. As of June 30, 2019, we leased 11,434 properties from property owners. On July 1, 2019, we sold and transferred leases of 10,167 properties. As of the date of this prospectus, we leased 1,267 properties from property owners. During the period when we held and managed over 10,000 leases, we saw the demands for and opportunities of a system that connects landlords, tenants, and service providers efficiently and combines management of internal operations and logistics with management of customers acquisition and development. We recruited a group of software engineers and invested in the development of a system that serves landlords in property rental transactions. Our operation and experience in the residential rental industry enabled us to identify challenges and implement solutions in our own software.  Finally, in July 2019, we launched SanCaiJia, our Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions. Our SanCaiJia solutions aim to serve the real estate rental industry and household service providers. Our clients include individual property owners, real estate management companies, leasing agencies, real estate agencies, apartments, decoration and renovation companies, and housekeeping and cleaning services. Customers of our clients have access to the software to view and connect with the agents to sign documents, pay rents, report repairs, etc. Our total revenue increased by approximately $4.24 million, or 116.02%, to approximately $7.89 million for the year ended September 30, 2021 from approximately $3.65 million (restated) for last fiscal year. The improvement in our revenue was mainly due to an increase in revenue from our SAAS customization & development services, which is a new service that we started to provide to our customers in October 2020. In fiscal year 2021, we developed new products and extended our expertise in other industries to leverage our existing SAAS knowledge and grow our customer base. Revenue from SaaS Platform standard service increased slightly by $0.18 million, or 4.88%, to $3.83 million for fiscal year 2021 (ended Sept. 30, 2021), from $3.65 million (restated) for last fiscal year. The revenue from SassS Platform for fiscal year 2021 was mainly from contract liabilities recorded in fiscal year 2020 for unrealized revenue. Our revenue from SasS platform standard service was mainly from rental property leasing transactions. During the fiscal year 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruption to the housing leasing industry in China. As a result, the transaction settlement amount decreased by $204.34 million, from $212.36 million for the fiscal year 2020 to $8.02 million for the fiscal year 2021. As there were no contract liabilities as of September 30, 2021, our revenue from unrealized SasS platform standard services will decrease in fiscal year 2022. However, we are now promoting the SaaS platform in different industries, especially in the agriculture industry to diversify the source of revenue and reduce the risk.

General Information,"(Note: IPOScoop has No Call on this micro-cap unit offering. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of our common stock.) We are a development-stage life sciences instrumentation and research services company engaged in the development of scientific assets and novel intellectual property across multiple “omics” fields. We intend to leverage our expertise with True Single Molecule Sequencing (“tSMS”) technology to enable researchers and clinicians to contribute major advancements to scientific research and development by accelerating one’s understanding of the molecular mechanisms of disease and fundamental biological processes. We believe our proprietary sequencing technology platform has critical advantages over existing Next Generation Sequencing (“NGS”) technologies, particularly for emerging applications in the research and development of biomarker discovery, epigenetics, nucleotide chemistry, forensics, and cell-free nucleic acid analysis. Our mission is to empower researchers with improved genetic tools that enable scientists and physicians to better understand the molecular mechanisms of disease and the underlying biological systems. This knowledge is essential to the continued development of new breakthroughs in genomic medicine that address the critical concerns involved with today’s precision medicine. Our single molecule technology enables researchers to identify and synthesize DNA or RNA strands, irrespective of abundance, in a biological sample and is capable of analyzing billions of molecules in parallel, which positions us as both competitive and complementary with other NGS platforms. We believe our technology advantage is a simplified method of quantifying DNA and RNA molecules at single molecule resolution because our platform does not require the routine PCR amplification and ligation steps required during library preparation by most NGS systems, thereby avoiding systematic bias and consequential additional costs. Our current sequencing platform offers advantages, such as the ability in certain samples to reveal previously-unknown molecular profiles, by directly detecting single molecules with little to no manipulation of the original sample. Our tSMS platform then generates data that is highly-accurate and creates reproducible molecular profiles, often providing researchers with new insights into the biology being researched. As supported by multiple peer-reviewed research publications, our tSMS technology platform has assisted medical researchers in uncovering potentially significant DNA and RNA biomarkers for the early detection of diseases.

General Information,"Our mission is to transform ophthalmology and optometry through the development and commercialization of proprietary devices that target the underlying causes of the world’s most prevalent eye diseases. Our currently marketed products, the OMNI Surgical System, or OMNI, and the TearCare System, or TearCare, target two of the world’s most prevalent and underserved eye diseases, glaucoma and dry eye disease, or DED, respectively. Glaucoma, a group of chronic, often asymptomatic, diseases that damage the optic nerve, is the world’s leading cause of irreversible blindness. Primary open-angle glaucoma, or POAG, is the most prevalent form of glaucoma. Dry eye complaints are the most common reason for a patient visit to an eye doctor and DED symptoms have a significant impact on the quality of life and productivity of patients. If left untreated, DED can be extremely painful, leading to permanent cornea damage and vision impairment. We estimate the annual addressable U.S. market opportunities for OMNI and TearCare are approximately $6 billion and approximately $10 billion, respectively, while 2020 U.S. manufacturer revenues in the surgical glaucoma and DED markets were approximately $350 million and $2.4 billion, respectively, demonstrating that currently available solutions have not addressed a large part of the market need. OMNI is a handheld, single-use, therapeutic device that allows ophthalmic surgeons to reduce intraocular pressure, or IOP, in adult glaucoma patients with a safe and minimally invasive glaucoma surgery, or MIGS. The FDA has authorized the use of OMNI for reducing IOP in all adult POAG patients both by itself on a standalone basis, which we refer to as Standalone procedures, or in combination with cataract procedures, which we refer to as Combination Cataract procedures.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with one product candidate in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial, and we are focused on leveraging our proprietary ImmunoTAC technology platform to develop systemically delivered, tissue targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, chronic viral infections, and other serious diseases. Initially, we are applying our platform to create a new class of targeted immuno-oncology agents that direct a myeloid cell activator to the tumor microenvironment (TME) in solid tumors to promote cancer cell killing.  Our lead product candidate, SBT6050, is comprised of a TLR8 agonist linker-payload conjugated to a HER2-directed monoclonal antibody that targets tumors such as certain breast, gastric and non-small cell lung cancers. SBT6050 is currently in a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic HER2-expressing solid tumors. In this trial, we have observed changes in pharmacodynamic markers in the first dose cohort, and we anticipate providing an update on interim data from the Phase 1 dose-escalation cohorts in the second half of 2021. SBT6290 is our second product candidate, expanding on the potential of a TLR8 agonist as a payload. SBT6290 is a TLR8 linker-payload conjugated to a monoclonal antibody that targets Nectin4, which is expressed in certain bladder, triple negative breast, head and neck, and non-small cell lung cancers. We anticipate submitting an investigational new drug application (IND) for SBT6290 in the fourth quarter of 2021.  Our third TLR8 program, SBT8230, is comprised of a TLR8 linker-payload conjugated to an ASGR1 monoclonal antibody that is under development for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus infection (cHBV). Our ImmunoTAC platform is the result of a focused effort to discover ways to systemically deliver disease-modifying small molecules in a directed fashion to sites of disease. Many potentially promising systemic therapies fail to maximize their therapeutic potential due to toxicities in healthy tissues. Our approach is designed to increase the therapeutic window and avert unacceptable toxicities by directly targeting specific disease sites where our therapeutics are locally active.

General Information,"We intend to initially focus on target businesses in the restaurant, hospitality, food and beverage, retail, consumer, food and food related technology and real estate industries Our leadership team is comprised of Steve Salis, Jamie Karson, Daniel Lee and Nestor Nova. The core of our team has worked together for the past three years at Salis Holdings, LLC (“SH”). SH was formed by Steve Salis in 2015 as a privately held multi-brand, multi-platform holding company based in Washington, D.C. Over the past three years, SH acquired Ted’s Bulletin from the Matchbox Group, a regional chain of modern American casual restaurants serving breakfast food all day and Kramerbooks, which pre-COVID, was to our knowledge, one of the higher grossing restaurant/bookstores in the country. Mr. Salis identified value in Ted’s Bulletin, which at the time of acquisition had negative comp store sales and declining guest counts. However, within six months after making the acquisition, Mr. Salis re-engineered the business ultimately making it one of the higher grossing per unit revenue generators, pre-COVID, in its category. Also during the past three years, SH launched Federalist Pig which has captured the attention of barbeque aficionados from across the country. All SH businesses have performed well during COVID and in keeping with Mr. Salis’ track record, have attracted institutional capital investment at expanding valuations. In response to the overwhelming demand for takeout and delivery, SH launched Fed Wings and Ensemble, a digital food hall housing its own brands for takeout and delivery which utilizes digital technology and native delivery logistics as key drivers. SH owns the real estate of certain of its restaurant brands and is seeking to acquire additional real estate as part of its overall strategy.

The stock symbol is “SKYX” on NASDAQ.) As electricity is a standard in every home and building, our mission is to make homes and buildings become safe-advanced and smart as the standard. Sky Technologies has a series of highly disruptive advanced-safe-smart platform technologies, with over 60 U.S. and global patents and patent pending applications. Our technologies place an emphasis on high quality and ease of use, while significantly enhancing both safety and lifestyle in homes and buildings. We believe that our products are a necessity in every room in both homes and other buildings in the U.S. and globally. Our first-generation technologies enable light fixtures, ceiling fans and other electrically wired products to be installed safely and plugged-in, into a ceiling’s electrical outlet box within seconds, and without the need to touch hazardous wires. The plug and play technology method is a universal power-plug device that has a matching receptacle that is simply connected to the electrical outlet box on the ceiling, enabling a safe and quick plug and play installation of light fixtures and ceiling fans in just seconds. The plug and play power-plug technology, eliminates the need of touching hazardous electrical wires while installing light fixtures, ceiling fans and other hard wired electrical products. In recent years we have developed prototypes that expand the capabilities of our power-plug product, to include advanced safe and quick universal installation methods, as well as advanced smart capabilities, which are currently in the third and final prototype stage prior to launching. The smart features contained in the final prototype include control of light fixtures and ceiling fans by the SkyHome App, through WIFI, Bluetooth Low Energy (“BLE”) and voice control connections. The SkyHome App will allow scheduling, energy savings eco mode, dimming, back-up emergency light, night light, light color changing and much more. We believe that due to safety, convenience, cost, and time that all hard-wired electrical products, such as light fixtures, ceiling fans and other products, should become plug and play and smart, as the standard, enabling consumers to plug their fixtures and control them through their smart phones at any time. Our second-generation technology, which is in the second stage prototype, is an all-in-one safe and smart advanced platform (the “Smart Sky Platform”) that is designed to enhance all-around safety and lifestyle of homes and other buildings. We believe that our patented advanced, safe and smart home platform technologies will make homes and buildings safer and smart as a standard, in a fraction of the time and cost, as compared to other market products.

The system uses our proprietary mechanism of action, which combines procedure fluid optimization, broad-spectrum acoustic energy and advanced fluid dynamics, to debride and disinfect deep regions of the complex root canal system in a less invasive procedure that preserves tooth structure. The clinical benefits of our GentleWave System when compared to conventional RCT methods include improved clinical outcomes, such as superior cleaning that is independent of root canal complexity and tooth anatomy, high and rapid rates of healing and minimal to no post-operative pain. The GentleWave System can also improve the workflow and economics of dental practices.  We began scaling commercialization of our current technology in 2017. We are focused on establishing the GentleWave Procedure as the standard of care for RCT. As of June 30, 2021, we had an installed base of over 700 GentleWave Systems, and we have treated more than 600,000 patients.

General Information,"We envision a world without burning fossil fuels. Our mission is: “Solar on Every Vehicle.” Our business was founded on a shared passion for finding a solution to climate-friendly, innovative and yet affordable mobility. The goal was to develop a solar powered, family-sized car for the mass market. To realize this goal, our founders assembled an experienced team of engineers, designers, technicians, and industry experts who spent years developing solar technology suited for mobility applications. We developed and tested several prototypes to advance and refine our technology and enlisted driver feedback to create a design that would be simultaneously functional, convenient to operate, environmentally sustainable, and affordable. (Incorporated in The Netherlands)  From this process, the Sion and our proprietary solar technology were born. The Sion is a solar electric vehicle, designed with a view to be accessible to everyday consumers and to be shared. Our technology allows us to integrate solar panels into the Sion’s bodywork to capture energy from the sun and store it in the Sion’s on-board battery. We believe the Sion unlocks the potential of solar energy in a car and advances our goal of providing a net-zero-emission vehicle solution for the mass market. We seek to license and sell our proprietary solar technology to a wide array of customers such as manufacturers of buses, trucks, camper vans, trains and even boats, in order to accelerate the transition towards sustainable transport and in order to have a second independent revenue stream.

General Information,"SOPHiA GENETICS was founded to generate clinically actionable insights from data to improve patient outcomes. Our mission is to provide equal access to knowledge and capabilities by democratizing data-driven medicine. We observed that across the healthcare ecosystem, a vast amount of digital healthcare data was being generated, fueled by technologies such as NGS (next-generation sequencing), and which held promise to accelerate the understanding of biology and disease. However, this data has been generated primarily using non-standardized methods and by clinicians and researchers across many healthcare institutions. As a result, the data remained siloed and complex and was not fully leveraged for the benefit of patients. We built a cloud-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) platform capable of analyzing data and generating insights from complex multimodal data sets and different diagnostic modalities. Our platform standardizes, computes and analyzes digital health data and is used across decentralized locations to break down data silos. This enables healthcare institutions to share knowledge and experiences and to build a collective intelligence. We envision a future in which all clinical diagnostic test data is channeled through a decentralized analytics platform that will provide insights powered by large real-world data sets and AI.

General Information,"(Note: This IPO is a unit offering. From the prospectus: “We have applied to list our common stock and Warrants on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbols “SOSH” and “SOSHW”.”) SOS Hydration, Inc. was founded by a veteran, a physician and a former professional track athlete, who were driven by their desire for a hydration product that could absorb quickly and had less sugar than the products that were available to them. SOS is an electrolyte replacement drink in the hydration drink category that provides products with less sugar than in traditional sports drinks such as Gatorade. Our products include SOS Hydration liquids and powders, as well as our PAW Patrol kids’ brand. (Incorporated in Nevada)  SOS specializes in providing electrolyte-enhanced products to consumers and organizations worldwide. The founders used the base line formula that the World Health Organization (the “WHO”) developed, called an oral rehydration solution, but lowered the sugar, added electrolytes that are balanced for active lifestyles (e.g., chloride is the second most electrolyte lost in perspiration) and then added minerals zinc and magnesium. The product, with its low sugar but high electrolyte concentration, activates the sodium glucose cotransport system, which is the body’s mechanism for transporting water and electrolytes into its cells. SOS began in retail with a six-store test in Kroger. Consumers can purchase our products through e-commerce channels, including the company’s own websites, and at approximately 12,000 brick-and-mortar retail stores, including Walmart, CVS, Kroger (and its subsidiaries), Whole Foods and other retail locations. **Note: For the year ended Dec. 31, 2021, our revenue was $3.72 million, and our net loss was $7.09 million.",Beverages,17,2013,Contact Information,"4822 Sterling Drive Boulder, CO 80301",(303) 834-9170,http://www.soshydration.com/,"SOS Hydration, Inc.",Financial Information,$38.67mil,$ mil (last 12 months),$ mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,SOSH,NASDAQ,1.4,$4.50 - $6.50,$7.5 mil,Maxim Group LLC,,,TBA,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,

General Information,"We are a leading global provider of drug containment, drug delivery and diagnostic solutions to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and life sciences industries. We deliver an integrated, end-to-end portfolio of products, processes and services that address customer needs across the entire drug life cycle at each of the development, clinical and commercial stages. Our core capabilities in scientific research and development, our commitment to technical innovation and our engineering excellence are central to our ability to offer value added solutions to our clients. We have secured a leadership position within the drug development and delivery value chain through our investment in research and development and the expansion of our global footprint and capabilities. Over our 70-year history, we have earned a leading reputation for high quality and reliability that has enabled us to become a partner of choice for more than 700 companies globally, including 41 of the top 50 pharmaceutical companies (which comprise all of the top 15), and eight of the top 10 in-vitro diagnostic companies, as measured by 2020 revenue, according to data collected by Global Data. We also serve 15 of the top 20 biotechnology companies by market capitalization in the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index and over 100 biotechnology customers in total. Our priority is to provide flexible solutions that preserve the integrity of pharmaceutical products and enable our customers to deliver safe and effective treatments to patients while reducing time to market, total cost of ownership (i.e., logistics, drug product waste, storage and personnel costs) and supply chain risk. We achieve this by developing our products in close collaboration with our customers, leveraging our scientific research capabilities, technical expertise and engineering and manufacturing excellence to meet their quality requirements. Our solutions are highly integrated with the development, production and commercialization processes of our customers. In addition to manufacturing drug containment and delivery solutions, we provide a full set of services across all stages of drug development, from pre-clinical to clinical stage and commercialization. We also engineer machinery and equipment for the production of drug containment and delivery systems that can be integrated into both our customers’ and our own manufacturing processes. Our involvement at each stage of a drug’s life cycle, together with the breadth of our offering, enables us to serve as a one-stop-shop for our customers, which we believe represents a significant competitive advantage. We operate across the healthcare industry and serve some of its fastest growing market segments, including biologics, biosimilars, vaccines and molecular diagnostics. As a result of how closely integrated we are in the drug production and delivery supply chain, we are well-positioned to benefit from secular trends within our target industries, such as increases in demand resulting from pharmaceutical innovation, acceleration and expansion of vaccination programs, growth in biologics/biosimilars, self-administration of medicines, aging demographics and increasing quality standards and regulation. We estimate that our total addressable market, based on our current offering, exceeds $11 billion, in terms of revenue generated by all market participants in 2020, and consists of biopharmaceutical injectables and in-vitro diagnostic products.

We intend to focus our efforts on seeking and completing an initial business combination with a company that has an enterprise value of between $600 million and $1.5 billion, although a target entity with a smaller or larger enterprise value may be considered. According to a report published by the Brookings Institute, we may be in the middle of a tipping point where a majority of the world’s population, for the first time ever, will live in middle-class or rich households. This report also suggests that the vast majority— about 88 percent—of the next billion entrants into the global middle class will be in Asia: 380 million Indians, 350 million Chinese, and 200 million other Asians. This makes India a very lucrative, fast -rowing market for tech-enabled products and services.

General Information,"We are a vertically integrated crypto asset mining company currently focused on mining Bitcoin. We wholly-own and operate a low-cost, environmentally beneficial coal refuse power generation facility that we have upgraded in Scrubgrass Township, Pennsylvania (the “Scrubgrass Plant”), and it is recognized as an Alternative Energy System because coal refuse is classified under Pennsylvania law as a Tier II Alternative Energy Source (equivalent to large-scale hydropower). We are committed to generating our energy and managing our assets sustainably, and we believe that we are one of the first vertically integrated crypto asset mining companies with a focus on environmentally beneficial operations. Simply put, we employ 21st century crypto mining techniques to remediate the impacts of 19th and 20th century coal mining in some of the most environmentally neglected regions of the United States. In addition to being environmentally-beneficial and sustainable, owning our own source of power helps us to produce Bitcoin at one of the lowest prices among our publicly traded peers. We also believe that owning our own power source makes us a more attractive partner to crypto asset mining equipment purveyors. For example, we have been able to enter into partnerships with crypto asset industry participants, including miner sharing arrangements, because we offered competitive power rates in a mutually beneficial arrangement. We believe other miner manufacturers or suppliers may be more willing to work with us because our vertical integration, strong financial position, and industrial scale make us a dependable partner. We have entered into a definitive agreement to purchase a second coal refuse power generation facility and a non-binding letter of intent to purchase a third coal refuse power generation facility. We intend to leverage these competitive advantages to continue to grow our business through the opportunistic acquisition of additional power generating assets and miners.

General Information,"Note: On April 11, 2018, Sun Country Airlines was acquired by the Apollo Funds, affiliated with the private equity firm, the Apollo Group. Sun Country Airlines is a new breed of hybrid low-cost air carrier that dynamically deploys shared resources across our synergistic scheduled service, charter and cargo businesses. By doing so, we believe we are able to generate high growth, high margins and strong cash flows with greater resilience than other passenger airlines. We focus on serving leisure and visiting friends and relatives (“VFR”) passengers and charter customers and providing CMI service to Amazon, with flights throughout the United States and to destinations in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.  Based in Minnesota, we operate an agile network that includes our scheduled service business and our synergistic charter and cargo businesses. We share resources, such as flight crews, across our scheduled service, charter and cargo business lines with the objective of generating higher returns and margins and mitigating the seasonality of our route network. We optimize capacity allocation by market, time of year, day of week and line of business by shifting flying to markets during periods of peak demand and away from markets during periods of low demand with far greater frequency than nearly all other large U.S. passenger airlines. We believe our flexible business model generates higher returns and margins while also providing greater resiliency to economic and industry downturns than a traditional scheduled service carrier. As a result of our diversified and resilient business model, we believe we have been the best-performing mainline U.S. passenger airline in 2020 during the current COVID-19 induced industry downturn, based on pre-tax and operating income margins for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020.

General Information,"Over the last 15 years, we have been leading a movement to re-imagine fast food for a new era. There is a powerful shift happening in consumer behavior. Every day more people want to eat healthier food and care about the impact their choices have on the environment. This is becoming the new normal, and we believe sweetgreen is well positioned to be a category-defining food brand for the future. Today, sweetgreen is one of the fastest-growing restaurant companies in the United States by revenue. As of Sept. 26, 2021, we owned and operated 140 restaurants in 13 states and Washington, D.C., and employed over 5,000 team members. We have thoughtfully designed all of our restaurants to both reflect the culture and feel of our local communities and to support our multiple digital channels. For our fiscal year to date through Sept. 26, 2021, 68% of our revenue came through our Total Digital Channels, with 47% of our revenue coming from our Owned Digital Channels (and the remaining 32% of our revenue attributable to Non-Digital transactions made through our In-Store Channel). We have collaborated with some of the world’s best chefs, athletes and musicians to amplify our mission, including our recent partnership with world champion tennis player and longtime sweetgreen fan, Naomi Osaka. In both 2019 and 2020 we were named as one of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies of the Year.
