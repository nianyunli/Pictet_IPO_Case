General Information,"We are a clinical stage immuno-oncology biopharmaceutical company developing precision T cell therapies to treat multiple types of solid tumors. We are focused on advancing cancer therapies through our pioneering work in the field of tumor evolution and our belief that clonal neoantigens represent the most specific class of cancer cell targets. Our platform enables us to identify mutations formed early in the development of a cancer that give rise to antigens that are expressed by all of a patient’s cancer cells but are absent from healthy tissue. We refer to this novel class of solid tumor targets as clonal neoantigens. To identify clonal neoantigens in a patient, we have developed a proprietary bioinformatic platform called PELEUS. This platform employs sophisticated statistical algorithms trained on the unique tumor genetic data derived from our exclusive license to data from the TRACERx study, which aims to analyze tumor samples from more than 840 non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, patients. Once we have identified the clonal neoantigens, our proprietary manufacturing process, VELOS, uses the patient’s T cells and blood-derived dendritic cells to create a Clonal Neoantigen Targeting T cell therapy, or cNeT, that specifically targets multiple clonal neoantigens to eradicate the tumor. We are currently conducting two open-label Phase I/IIa trials to evaluate our cNeT product candidate, ATL001, in advanced NSCLC and metastatic or recurrent melanoma; we expect to report interim data from these trials in the second half of 2022.

General Information,"(Note: This IPO is a unit offering. IPOScoop has NO CALL on unit IPOs.) Aclarion is a healthcare technology company that leverages Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (“MRS”), and a proprietary biomarker to optimize clinical treatments. Aclarion’s technology addresses the $134.5B U.S. low back and neck pain market, which according to a 2020 JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) article is now the most costly healthcare condition in the United States. The company is currently utilizing Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) to assist in quality control processes that flag spectroscopy data indicative of a poor MRS study. The use of AI in this application is early in its development cycle and is expected to evolve with further research and development. The company is also researching the application of AI and machine learning platforms to analyze both the raw spectroscopy data and the post-processed signal to evaluate whether AI platforms can more efficiently and more effectively associate MRS data with clinical outcomes. The use of AI in this application is aspirational and we intend this type of AI research and development to be an ongoing process applied not only to the various treatment paths associated with back pain, such as conservative therapies, regenerative and cell therapies and surgical intervention, but also to potentially expand into other clinical explorations involving the diagnosis of brain, breast and prostate tumors. The company, which has limited sales to date, is addressing this market by initially focusing on improving the outcomes of surgical interventions to treat low back pain. In this initial application, Aclarion technology is intended to assist surgeons in determining the optimal surgical procedure for a patient undergoing surgery for pain isolated to their lumbar spine (the “lumbar spine” is comprised of the five (5) lower vertebrae, L-1 to L-5). We then intend to add additional applications of our technology targeting the management of large segments of low back pain patients from the point of initial MRI through to episode resolution. We believe this will expand the use of our technology to low back pain patients undergoing conservative therapies such as physical therapy or biologic and cell therapies aimed at regenerating the lumbar discs. The core technology Aclarion employs is MR Spectroscopy. The patient experience when undergoing an MRS exam is exactly like that of a standard MRI, with the exception of an additional 3-5 minutes for each disc undergoing a spectroscopy exam. Whereas a standard MRI produces a signal that is converted into anatomical images, an MRS produces a signal that is converted into a waveform that identifies the chemical composition of tissues. Just like with standard MRI’s, the data from spectroscopy is useless without technologies that can process the data. Aclarion has developed proprietary signal processing software that transforms spectroscopy data into clear biomarkers. These biomarkers, which are exclusively licensed from the University of California, San Francisco (“UCSF”), are the key data inputs for our proprietary algorithms that, when applied, determine if an intervertebral disc is consistent with pain. Our patent portfolio includes 21 U.S. Patents, 17 Foreign Patents, 6 pending U.S. patent applications, and 7 pending Foreign patent application, including patents and patent applications exclusively licensed from UCSF.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel disease-modifying approach to target what we believe to be a key underlying cause of Alzheimer’s disease, or AD. Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the brain that leads to loss of memory and cognitive functions and ultimately results in death. Our scientific founders pioneered research on soluble amyloid-beta oligomers, or AbOs, globular assemblies of the amyloid-beta, or Ab, peptide that are distinct from Ab monomers and amyloid plaques. Based on decades of research and supporting evidence, AbOs have gained increasing scientific acceptance as a primary toxin involved in the initiation and propagation of AD pathology. We are currently focused on advancing a targeted immunotherapy drug candidate, ACU193, and establishing proof of mechanism in early AD patients. ACU193 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively targets AbOs, has demonstrated functional and protective effects in in vitro assays, and has demonstrated in vivo safety and pharmacologic activity in multiple animal species including transgenic models for AD. We initiated our Phase 1 clinical trial of ACU193 in the second quarter of 2021 with the objective to evaluate its safety and tolerability and explore its pharmacokinetics and target engagement. This trial is enrolling patients with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment, or MCI, due to AD, conditions referred to as “early AD.” Our ACU193 Phase 1 data intended to evaluate safety and tolerability and demonstrate clinical proof of mechanism are expected by year end 2022.

General Information,"We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new class of antibiotics for infections caused by bacteria listed as priority pathogens by the World Health Organization (“WHO”), the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Priority pathogens are those which require new antibiotics to address the worldwide crisis of antimicrobial resistance (“AMR”), as identified by the WHO, CDC and FDA. The CDC estimates that, in the U.S., antibiotic-resistant pathogens infect one individual every 11 seconds and result in one death every 15 minutes. The WHO recently stated that growing antimicrobial resistance is equally as dangerous as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, threatens to unwind a century of medical progress and may leave us defenseless against infections that today can be treated easily. According to the WHO, the current clinical development pipeline remains insufficient to tackle the challenge of the increasing emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance. Our approach is to develop antibiotic candidates that block the DNA polymerase IIIC enzyme (Pol IIIC) . We believe we are developing the first Pol IIIC inhibitor to enter clinical trials. Pol IIIC is the primary catalyst for DNA replication of several Gram-positive bacterial cells. Our research and development pipeline includes clinical stage and early stage antibiotic candidates that target Gram-positive bacteria for oral and/or parenteral treatment of infections caused by Clostridium difficile (“C. difficile”), Enterococcus (including vancomycin-resistant strains (“VRE”)), Staphylococcus (including methicillin-resistant strains (“MRSA”)), and Streptococcus (including antibiotic-resistant strains). Pol IIIC is required for the replication of DNA in certain Gram-positive bacterial species. By blocking this enzyme, our antibiotic candidates are believed to be bactericidal and inhibit proliferation of several common bacterial pathogens, including both sensitive and resistant C. difficile, MRSA, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumonia (“PRSP”) and other resistant bacteria.

General Information,"We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing drugs that meaningfully improve the lives of patients with rare cardiopulmonary disease. Our initial focus is on advancing AV-101, our dry powder inhaled formulation of imatinib for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH, a devastating disease impacting approximately 70,000 people in the United States and Europe. Imatinib, marketed as Gleevec tablets, was originally developed for the treatment of multiple cancers. Oral imatinib also demonstrated statistically significant improvement on the primary endpoint, six-minute walk distance, and multiple secondary hemodynamic endpoints in PAH patients in an international Phase 3 trial conducted by Novartis but was poorly tolerated due to adverse events, or AEs, and never approved for the treatment of PAH. We anticipate initiating a Phase 2b/3 trial of AV-101 in PAH patients in the second half of 2021, and we have assembled a team with deep expertise in developing innovative PAH and inhaled therapies and commercializing novel drugs.  PAH is an orphan disease with unmet medical need; it is characterized by high pressure in the vessels transporting blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs. This high pressure is caused by abnormal cellular proliferation, which over time results in narrowing of the pulmonary vessels and forces the heart to work harder to pump blood through the lungs. The severe blood flow restriction and strain on the heart becomes increasingly severe over time and ultimately leads to heart failure that is often fatal.

General Information,"AFC Gamma, Inc. is a commercial real estate finance company founded in July 2020 by a veteran team of investment professionals. We originate, structure, underwrite and manage senior secured loans and other types of loans for established companies operating in the cannabis industry in states that have legalized medicinal and/or adult use cannabis. As states continue to legalize cannabis for medical and adult use, an increasing number of companies operating in the cannabis industry need financing. Due to the capital-constrained cannabis market which does not typically have access to traditional bank financing and faces limitations on accessing equity markets, we believe we are well positioned to become a prudent financing source to established cannabis industry operators, given our stringent underwriting criteria, size and scale of operations, and institutional infrastructure.

General Information,"We are a preclinical stage company pioneering a new class of rationally designed gene therapies with potentially curative benefit in patients with both rare and prevalent devastating diseases. Our rationally designed gene therapy candidates are methodically created to address the key limitations of current approaches and to meet the specific needs of a disease. We created our proprietary Affinia Rationally-designed Therapies (ART) platform to develop these novel therapies, focusing on the three key components of a gene therapy: capsids, which are the outer shells of a virus used to deliver the genetic code to tissues to treat a disease; promoters, which control how the cells read the genetic code that is delivered; and manufacturing approaches, which determine the quality and cost of these potential medicines. Our goal is to realize the full promise of gene therapy by addressing key limitations of current approaches, including tissue targeting specificity, cell expression and manufacturability. The potential of our platform has attracted a team of seasoned executives with extensive experience in advancing transformational gene therapy technologies from discovery through approval and commercialization. Our lead product candidate, AFTX-001, is Anc80L65-ARSA for the treatment of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). MLD is a rare, rapidly progressive and fatal genetic disease that results from the deficiency of functional arylsulfatase A (ARSA), an enzyme that is critical for neuronal survival. Patients with the most common form of MLD, called late infantile MLD, typically die before the age of eight years. We anticipate an IND submission for AFTX-001 in the first half of 2023. Our second product candidate, AFTX-002, is Anc80L65-trastuzumab for the treatment of brain metastases secondary to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 overexpressing (HER2+) breast cancer (BMBC). BMBC is a common and deadly complication of HER2+ breast cancer with a median survival of only 18 months. Trastuzumab is an approved monoclonal antibody for the treatment of HER2+ breast cancer; however current methods of administration are impractical for achieving sustained therapeutic levels in the brain sufficient to be effective against BMBC. We anticipate an IND submission for AFTX-002 in the second half of 2023. In addition to our MLD and BMBC programs, we are also engineering capsids for use in programs for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), myotonic dystrophy 1 (DM1) and cystic fibrosis (CF) via a multi-year collaboration (Vertex Agreement) that we entered into in 2020 with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (Vertex).",BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS (NO DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCES),63,2019,Contact Information,"43 Foundry Ave, Suite 120 Waltham, MA 02453",617-430-7817,http://www.affiniatx.com/,"Affinia Therapeutics, Inc.",Financial Information,,$8.06 mil (last 12 months),$-39.77 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,AFTX,NASDAQ,0.0,$0.00 - $0.00,$100.0 mil,Goldman Sachs/ Jefferies/ Piper Sandler/ Chardan,-,,TBA,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,
General Information,"Affirm offers a “Buy Now, Pay Later” service as an alternative to traditional credit cards. Our business benefits from broader trends in technology, retail, finance and e-commerce. For example, Gen Z and Millennials, people born between 1981 and 2012, now comprise the largest proportion of the U.S. population and are driving the rapid growth in e-commerce as every element of commerce moves online. The spending power of this new generation of consumers reached over $2.5 trillion in 2020, according to YPulse. We are building the next-generation platform for digital and mobile-first commerce. Our point-of-sale solution allows consumers to pay for purchases in fixed amounts without deferred interest, hidden fees, or penalties. We empower consumers to pay over time rather than paying for a product entirely upfront. Our platform facilitates both true 0% APR payment options and interest-bearing loans. With 0% APR, consumers pay zero interest and zero additional costs. On the interest-bearing loans we facilitate, we charge simple interest, which means consumers pay fixed amounts of interest that they agree to up front, and the interest never compounds.

General Information,"Our business is transforming healthcare by empowering the primary care physician (“PCP”) to be the agent for change in the communities they serve. We believe that PCPs, with their intimate patient-physician relationships, are best positioned to drive meaningful change in quality, cost and patient experience when provided with the right infrastructure and payment model. Through our combination of the agilon platform, a long-term partnership model with existing physician groups and a growing network of like-minded physicians, we are poised to revolutionize healthcare for seniors across communities throughout the United States. Our purpose-built model provides the necessary capabilities, capital and business model for existing physician groups to create a Medicare-centric, globally capitated line of business. Our model operates by forming risk-bearing entities (each, an “RBE”) within local geographies, that enter into arrangements with payors providing for monthly payments to manage the total healthcare needs of our physician partners’ attributed patients (or, global capitation arrangements), contract with agilon to perform certain functions and enter into long-term professional service agreements with one or more anchor physician groups pursuant to which the anchor physician groups receive a base compensation rate and share in the savings from successfully improving quality of care and reducing costs. Our company was formed in 2016, and we established our inaugural partnership with an anchor physician group in 2017. Our ability to rapidly build scaled positions in local communities has allowed us to grow to 16 anchor physician groups and 17 geographies in fewer than five years. Our platform has enabled us to grow our total membership by 45% and revenue by 53% from Dec. 31, 2019, to Dec. 31, 2020. Currently, the PCPs on our platform serve approximately 210,000 patients enrolled in Medicare Advantage (“MA”), which includes approximately 49,000 patients with physician groups contracted to go-live on Jan. 1, 2022 (we refer to these patients as the “members on our platform”).",Services - Allied Health Services,552,2016,Contact Information,"1 World Trade Center, Suite 2000 Long Beach, CA 90831",(562) 256-3800,http://www.agilonhealth.com,"agilon health, inc.",Financial Information,$8274.06mil,$1218.33 mil (last 12 months),$-60.05 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,AGL,NYSE,46.6,$23.00 - $23.00,$1071.8 mil,J.P.

General Information,"(Note: This is a unit offering IPO. IPOScoop has NO CALL on unit offerings.) Agora was organized by our parent and principal stockholder, Ecoark Holdings, Inc. (“Ecoark”) to enter the digital asset mining business. Because of regulatory uncertainty over digital assets being deemed to be securities, Agora’s initial focus is on mining Bitcoin, which has not currently been deemed as a security. Because of regulatory concerns and the changing regulatory environment, we intend to seek opportunities to engage with cryptocurrencies that do not involve the offer or sale of any securities. (Incorporated in Nevada) On Sept. 22, 2021, Ecoark assigned 100% of the membership interests of Trend Discovery Holdings LLC to Agora, and Trend Discovery is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Agora. Through Trend Discovery, Agora operates the following wholly owned subsidiaries: Bitstream Mining LLC, Barrier Crest LLC, Trend Discovery Capital Management LLC and Trend Discovery Exploration LLC (“Trend Exploration”). We are keeping the Bitcoin we acquire in a digital wallet with Coinbase, a large digital asset exchange. We may use our companies for this purpose as well. We are subject to a variety of cybersecurity risks resulting from this arrangement. Bitstream was organized in the Spring of 2021 to be our principal cryptocurrency subsidiary. Bitstream has entered into a series of agreements, including arranging for a reliable and economical electric power source needed to efficiently mine Bitcoin, ordering miners, housing infrastructure and other infrastructure to mine Bitcoin and locate a third-party hosting service to operate our miners and the service’s more advanced miners. Agora has spent approximately $7.2 million and has agreed to spend approximately $6 million in connection with these agreements, not including future revenue sharing. We purchased 5,000 Canaan AvalonMiner 841 miners, of which 4,000 have been delivered, and 550 are currently being operated. On November 6, 2021, we commenced Bitcoin mining on a beta test basis. Because these Canaan AvalonMiner 841 miners are less powerful than the other miners we have ordered, we may lose money on our initial mining operations. Our hosting service expects to deploy Bitmain S19 Pro miners, which are expected to be operational in the first quarter of calendar year 2022. In order to advance our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) strategy and seek a way to reduce the power costs of our planned mining activities, an Ecoark subsidiary made an intercompany assignment of certain oil and gas mineral leases to Agora’s subsidiary, Trend Exploration. Trend Exploration has been investigating the use of flared or stranded natural gas to fuel a turbine to generate the energy required to mine cryptocurrency. As we seek a solution, the oil wells generate approximately $100,000 per month of revenue at current prices. Barrier Crest provides fund administration and related services for small hedge funds. Trend Discovery owns an entity which is the general partner and manager, respectively, but not the investment manager, of two investment funds. These investment funds own shares of Ecoark and one also owns warrants of Ecoark. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” As reflected in the financial statements contained in this prospectus, during the period ended Dec. 31, 2021, a majority of our revenue was generated from Barrier Crest, Trend Capital Management and Trend Exploration. We expect a majority of our revenue to primarily be generated by Bitstream following the commencement of our initial cryptocurrency mining operations in November 2021.",Services - Computer Processing & Data Preparation,10,2019,Contact Information,"145 King Street, Suite 410 Charleston, South Carolina 29401",(800) 219-0518,,Agora Digital Holdings,Financial Information,,$0.48 mil (last 12 months),$-0.02 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,DEFYU,NASDAQ,0.0,$0.00 - $0.00,$0.0 mil,H.C.

General Information,"Alignment is a next-generation, consumer-centric platform that is revolutionizing the healthcare experience for seniors. We deliver this experience through our Medicare Advantage plans, which are customized to meet the needs of individual seniors across the United States. We created Alignment based on the frustrating experiences we had when our parents and other loved ones needed healthcare. We saw firsthand the complexity they faced as seniors attempting to navigate care delivery and insurance without an advocate to create an integrated consumer experience that provides holistic and quality care at an affordable price. Our parents and seniors across the country are systemically and disproportionately impacted by the absence of care coordination, poor information transparency and misaligned incentives that characterize the healthcare system. Our team of highly experienced healthcare leaders created the Alignment model to incorporate the lessons we have learned over decades spent serving senior consumers. We believe that by combining our experienced, mission-driven team with purpose-built technology, we have found a way to address the unmet needs of senior consumers and to “do well by doing good.” Our ultimate goal is to bring this differentiated, advocacy-driven healthcare experience to millions of senior consumers in the United States and to become the most trusted senior healthcare brand in the country.",HOSPITAL & MEDICAL SERVICE PLANS,775,2013,Contact Information,"1100 W.

General Information,"Our mission is to empower financial institutions to grow confidently, adapt quickly and build thriving digital communities. Alkami is a cloud-based digital banking platform. We inspire and empower community, regional and super-regional financial institutions (“FIs”) to compete with large, technologically advanced and well-resourced banks in the United States. Our solution, the Alkami Platform, allows FIs to onboard and engage new users, accelerate revenues and meaningfully improve operational efficiency, all with the support of a proprietary, true cloud-based, multi-tenant architecture. We cultivate deep relationships with our clients through long-term, subscription-based contractual arrangements, aligning our growth with our clients’ success and generating an attractive unit economic model. In the early 2000s, digital engagement began revolutionizing industries overnight, forcing firms to invest and innovate or risk losing long-term relationships to well-resourced competitors. Within banking, many FIs were ill-equipped to compete with larger competitors, including the largest banks in the world, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo (collectively, “megabanks”), primarily due to resource constraints and the resulting inability to keep pace, technologically, with evolving consumer preferences for digital engagement. This led to the first digital banking platforms. We founded Alkami to help level the playing field for FIs. Our vision was to create a platform that combined premium technology and FinTech solutions in one integrated ecosystem, delivered as a SaaS solution and providing our clients’ customers with a single point of access to all things digital. (SaaS stands for Software-as-a-Service.)

General Information,"We are a clinical stage biotechnology company developing novel immune therapeutics for the prevention, treatment and mitigation of bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections that express the antigenic target poly N-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG). That target has been found on an expanding number of pathogens. While the ultimate decision on the safety and efficacy of our therapeutics will be determined by the FDA and other health authorities, it is our management’s assessment that the broad-spectrum potential of our therapeutics will allow them to be used for the prevention, treatment, and mitigation of a wide range of infections. In a first-in-man trial, our vaccine candidate, AV0328, has been shown to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events observed. It was noted to induce protective antibodies against all PNAG-expressing pathogens tested. We believe our vaccine’s broad-spectrum potential will allow it to be used for the long-term prevention of a wide range of infections including pneumococcal pneumonia, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), meningitis, and sexually transmitted diseases.  Similarly, our fully human monoclonal antibody, F598, which also targets PNAG, has been shown to be well tolerated and no serious adverse events were noted in phase 1 and pilot phase 2 trials. We believe it can provide immediate protection lasting 2-3 months. We seek to establish F598 as the standard of care for preventing and ameliorating gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial infections along with fungal infections by organisms that express PNAG in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU). Utilization of these therapeutics also has potential applicability beyond infectious diseases, including treatment of neurological conditions and cognitive decline due to inflammation.

General Information,"We intend to focus our efforts on businesses that leverage our management team’s experience in acquiring and operating businesses that are involved in renewable energy or related clean technology, which we refer to as the alternative energy sector. We intend to focus on the significant opportunities we believe will result from the ongoing transformation of the energy ecosystem and the macro trends related to electrification and decarbonization – global changes which Bloomberg Energy Finance (BNEF) projects will require an investment of between $78 trillion and $130 trillion through 2050. Specifically, we believe that select companies will represent opportunities stemming from these vast capital flows, and the best of these companies will provide exceptional high-growth investment opportunities.

General Information,"Our mission is to develop therapies that change the treatment paradigm for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, and a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases by keeping neurons alive. Unlike most other cells in the body that regularly die and are replaced as part of healthy function, mature neurons are normally resistant to cell death and generally cannot regenerate. We are pursuing commercialization of our product candidate, AMX0035, which we believe is the first drug candidate to show both a functional and survival benefit in a large-scale clinical trial of patients with ALS. We submitted a New Drug Submission, or NDS, in Canada in the second quarter of 2021 for AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS, which was accepted for review in the third quarter of 2021, and a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the fourth quarter of 2021, which was accepted for priority review in the same quarter. We also intend to submit a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in Europe early in the first quarter of 2022. The results of our Phase 2 clinical trial of AMX0035, known as the CENTAUR trial, were published in September 2020 in the New England Journal of Medicine and in October 2020 in the Journal of Muscle and Nerve and demonstrated functional and survival benefits for ALS patients. We believe AMX0035 has the potential to be a foundational therapy, meaning that it could be used alone or in conjunction with other therapies to change the treatment paradigm across a broad range of neurodegenerative diseases. AMX0035 is a dual UPR-Bax apoptosis inhibitor composed of sodium phenylbutyrate, or PB, and TURSO (also known as tauroursodeoxycholic acid, or TUDCA). Through the resolution of the unfolded protein response, or UPR, and by inhibiting translocation of the Bcl-2 Associated X-protein, or Bax, to the outer mitochondrial membrane, we have shown in multiple models that AMX0035 can keep neurons alive under a variety of different conditions and stresses, including in in vitro models of neurodegeneration, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and disease-specific models of a variety of other conditions, as well as in vivo models of ALS, Alzheimer’s Disease, or AD, and multiple sclerosis. We are pursuing ALS as our first indication as it is a disease of rapid and profound neurodegeneration. We are actively pursuing regulatory approvals of AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS in Canada, the United States and, in the near-term, Europe. We have recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial of AMX0035 for the treatment of ALS, known as the PHOENIX trial, at clinical trial sites in the United States and Europe.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatments for rare, chronic and serious infectious diseases with high unmet needs. Our initial product candidate is epetraborole, a once-daily oral treatment for patients with chronic non-tuberculous mycobacterial, or NTM, lung disease. Epetraborole has broad spectrum antimycobacterial activity through inhibition of an essential and universal step in bacterial protein synthesis. Its novel mechanism of action is enabled by boron chemistry, our core technology approach. There are an estimated 200,000 patients with NTM lung disease in the United States; however, many remain underdiagnosed due to lack of clinical suspicion, nonspecific respiratory symptoms, and underlying lung diseases that are frequent in patients with this infection. We intend to conduct trials and pursue marketing authorizations with epetraborole in additional geographies outside of the United States and Europe, with an initial focus in Japan. We estimate that there are approximately 20,000 patients with NTM lung disease and approximately 5,600 patients with treatment-refractory MAC lung disease in Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Spain). We estimate that there are approximately 220,000 patients with NTM lung disease and approximately 21,000 patients with treatment-refractory MAC lung disease in Japan. We plan to conduct a Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial in treatment-refractory Mycobacterium avium complex, or MAC, lung disease, which is the most common type of NTM lung disease. Interim data from our completed Phase 1b dose-ranging study of epetraborole administered orally for 28 days in healthy volunteers in Australia and data from our two nonclinical chronic toxicology studies (six-month rats and nine-month non-human primates) have informed our selection of a 500 mg once-daily dose for our Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial in treatment-refractory MAC lung disease patients. We believe our Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial design, which is under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has the potential to be sufficient for regulatory approval in the United States.  We recently received clearance of our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application by the FDA to begin our Phase 1 renal impairment study, for which enrollment commenced in February 2022, and plan to initiate patient enrollment in our Phase 2/3 pivotal clinical trial in the first half of 2022, with topline results for the Phase 2 part of the trial anticipated in the middle of 2023 and for the Phase 3 part of the trial anticipated in the middle of 2024, pending any sample size adjustments that may be required to the Phase 3 portion based on treatment effects of epetraborole-containing regimens that may be observed in the Phase 2 portion of the trial, if any. We also recently received Fast Track designation by the FDA to investigate epetraborole for treatment-refractory MAC lung disease. Epetraborole has also recently been designated as a Qualified Infectious Disease Product, or QIDP, for treatment-refractory MAC lung disease by the FDA and received FDA orphan drug designation for the treatment of infections caused by NTM. *Note: Net loss is for the year ended Dec. 31, 2021.

General Information,"Michael M. Andretti, the celebrated race car driver, is the co-CEO of this blank-check company or SPAC, which will focus on the automotive industry. (Incorporated in the Cayman Islands) We intend to leverage the extensive experience and vast network of our management team to complete our initial business combination. Two key members of our management team are racing legends Mario and Michael Andretti: Mario Andretti is a former Formula One World Champion racecar driver and one of only three drivers to win races in Formula One, IndyCar, World Sportscar Championship and the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (“NASCAR”). He is one of only two drivers to have won both the Daytona 500 and the Indy 500. His son, Michael Andretti, won the PPG IndyCar World Series in 1991 and has tallied 42 race wins throughout his career. As owner of Andretti Autosport, Michael Andretti has led his team to over 200 race wins, including four IndyCar Championships.  This legacy has made Andretti a household name with 75% of Americans familiar with the iconic brand, which connotes luxury, lifestyle and performance. Among its many successes, Andretti Autosport has leveraged the popularity of the Andretti brand to undertake sustainability initiatives, including helping underprivileged communities, as well as developing a competitive electric vehicle platform powered by renewable energy. The Andretti brand is complemented by Andretti Technologies, an advanced engineering and innovation arm that has enabled Andretti to raise the bar for automotive performance. We currently seek to focus on opportunities that can benefit from the iconic Andretti brand name, both inside and outside of the worldwide motor sports platform and the expertise and ability of our management team to identify, acquire and grow a business in the broadly defined automotive industry. This industry includes but is not limited to advanced mobility and related next-generation technologies, premium and performance vehicles and replacement automotive parts.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing novel solutions for people suffering from cannabinoid overdose and substance addiction. Our lead product candidate, ANEB-001, is intended to reverse the negative effects of cannabinoid overdose within 1 hour of administration. The signs and symptoms of cannabinoid overdose range from profound sedation to anxiety and panic to psychosis with hallucinations. There is no approved medical treatment currently available to specifically alleviate the symptoms of cannabinoid overdose and we are not aware of any competing products that are further along in the development process than ANEB-001 in reversing the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”), the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis. Clinical trials completed to date have shown that ANEB-001 is rapidly absorbed, well tolerated and leads to weight loss, an effect that is consistent with central cannabinoid receptor type 1 (“CB1”) antagonism. In March 2021, our European clinical trial application (“CTA”), which is equivalent to an investigational new drug application in the United States, was accepted in the Netherlands to allow us to utilize ANEB-001 in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial for cannabinoid overdose planned for the fourth quarter of 2021. Before the legalization of cannabis, an estimated 450,000 patients visited hospital emergency rooms for cannabis-related conditions. In 2014, this number more than doubled to an estimated 1.1 million patients, according to data published in “Trends and Related Factors of Cannabis-Associated Emergency Department Visits in the United States: 2006-2014,” Journal of Addiction Medicine (May/June 2019). Based on our own analysis of the most recent NEDS (The Nationwide Emergency Department Sample) data, we believe that the number of hospitalizations grew to 1.74 million patients in 2018. Excessive ingestion of THC via edible products such as candies and brownies, and overdoses of synthetic cannabinoids (also known as “synthetics,” “K2” or “spice”), are two leading causes of THC-related emergency room visits.",PHARMACEUTICAL PREPARATIONS,3,2020,Contact Information,"1415 Ranch Road 620 South, Suite 201 Lakeway, Texas 78734",(512) 598-0931,http://www.anebulo.com/,"Anebulo Pharmaceuticals, Inc.",Financial Information,$162.89mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$-0.76 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,ANEB,NASDAQ,3.0,$7.00 - $7.00,$21.0 mil,The Benchmark Company,-,5/7/2021,Priced,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company reimagining cell therapy through the development of innovative immunotherapies for patients with cancer and other incurable diseases. We believe cell therapies are one of the forward pillars of medicine, and our mission is to advance humanity by engineering cell therapies that are safer, more effective and more broadly accessible. Though cell therapies have shown benefits to date, cell therapies have historically been constrained to existing biologic structures, which has limited their impact and opportunity. Our novel synthetic binding scaffold, the D-Domain, was engineered to overcome the limitations of traditional Chimeric Antigen Receptor T cells (CAR-Ts). Existing cell therapy solutions, most of which use a biologic-based, single chain variable fragment (scFv) binding domain, tend to be beneficial to a limited segment of patients, often result in high toxicity, and have narrow applicability in treatable indications. We believe we can overcome these limitations by engineering a new class of D-Domain powered autologous and allogeneic CAR-Ts, including classical single infusion CAR-Ts called ddCARs and dosable and controllable universal CAR-Ts called ARC-SparX, to address hematologic cancers, solid tumors, and indications outside of oncology, such as autoimmune diseases. At the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology (ASH), we recently announced positive preliminary results from our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of CART-ddBCMA, our lead ddCAR product candidate, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) multiple myeloma (MM), defined as patients with either minimal response or disease progression within 60 days of last treatment.

General Information,"We are a leading provider of interconnect and other intellectual property (“IP”) technology that manages the on-chip communications in System-on-Chip (“SoC”) semiconductor devices. Our products enable our customers to deliver increasingly complex SoCs that not only process data but are also able to make decisions. Growth in the total addressable market (“TAM”) for our solutions is being driven by the addition of more processors, channels of memory access, machine learning sections, chiplets, additional input/output (“I/O”) interface standards and other subsystems within SoCs. The growth in the numbers of these connected on-chip subsystems places an increasing premium on the interconnect IP’s capability to move data inside complex SoCs. We believe this increase in SoC complexity is creating a significant opportunity for sophisticated SoC system IP solutions, which consist of Network-on-Chip (“NoC”) interconnect IP, IP deployment software and NoC interface IP (consisting of peripheral data transport IPs and control plane networks connected to NoC interconnect IP). Founded in 2003, we believe we have pioneered and emerged as a global leader in the development of interconnect IP technology for on-chip communication that address the complexity, performance and cost requirements of advanced SoC semiconductors. Over time, we have expanded and scaled our interconnect IP and other IP businesses to provide hardware, software, documentation licenses, support and training under a license fee and a royalty business model, to companies that design and produce semiconductors worldwide. Our IP deployment solutions, which were significantly enhanced by our acquisition of Magillem Design Services SA (“Magillem”) in late 2020, complement our interconnect IP solutions by helping to automate not only the customer configuration of interconnects, but also the process of integrating and assembling all the customer’s IP blocks into an SoC. Products incorporating our IP are used to carry important data inside complex SoCs for sophisticated applications, including automated driving, artificial intelligence/machine learning (“AI/ML”), 5G and wireless communications, data centers, and consumer electronics, among other applications.

General Information,"(Note: This biotech company is focused on developing synthetic psychedelic compounds to treat mental health disorders, including treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and substance abuse disorder. Billionaire Peter Thiel invested $12 million in this start-up in November 2020 through Thiel Capital, his venture capital firm, as part of a $125 million private fund-raising round, CNBC reported.) We have a bold and ambitious vision: to heal mental health disorders so that everyone, everywhere can live a more fulfilled life. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company aiming to transform the treatment of mental health disorders. We founded atai Life Sciences in 2018 as a response to the significant unmet need and lack of innovation in the mental health treatment landscape, as well as the emergence of therapies that previously may have been overlooked or underused, including psychedelic compounds and digital therapeutics. We have built a pipeline of 10 development programs and six enabling technologies, each led by focused teams with deep expertise in their respective fields and supported by our internal development and operational infrastructure. We believe that several of our therapeutic programs’ target indications have potential market opportunities of at least $1 billion in annual sales, if approved. One of our atai companies, Recognify Life Sciences, has initiated a Phase 2a trial in the United States. We expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial for another program in 2021 and an additional three Phase 2 trials for other programs in 2022. We also expect to initiate Phase 1 trials for two of our programs in 2021 and an additional four in 2022. Mental health disorders such as depression, substance use disorder, or SUD, and anxiety, which are among our initial focus indications, are highly prevalent and estimated to affect more than one billion people globally. Additionally, it is expected that more than 50% of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with a mental health disorder at some point in their lifetime, with increasing incidence ascribed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those suffering from mental health disorders have higher mortality rates than the general population and often experience decreased quality of life as a result of emotional, behavioral or physical manifestations. In addition, the total costs of mental health disorders are significant and expected to increase substantially. Between 2009 and 2019, spending on mental health care in the United States increased by more than 50%, reaching $225 billion. A Lancet Commission report estimates the global economic cost will reach $16 trillion by 2030. While current treatments, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs, and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs, are well established and effective for certain patients, a significant percentage of patients either respond inadequately or relapse, translating to a significant unmet patient need.

We were originally formed to provide the broadcast radio industry with digital consumer products (mobile apps and web applications) that increased radio listener engagement and generated new revenue for radio stations from synchronized audio-digital advertisements. The company is now developing new software technologies for audio media companies and consumers of audio media, more generally. The Company has developed an artificial intelligence (“AI”) platform on top of Google’s TensorFlow open source library that is being “taught” to know the difference between all types of audio content on the radio. For instance, the platform recognizes the difference between a commercial and a song and is learning the differences between all other content to include weather reports, traffic, news, sports, DJ conversation, etc. Not only does the technology learn the differences between the various types of audio segments, it also identifies the beginning and end of each piece of content.

General Information,"(Note: This is NOT an IPO. This is a NASDAQ uplisting from the OTCQX Market.) The medical note documentation burden in the United States is significant and is a major contributor to physician burnout. According to a 2019 study in the Annals of Internal Medicine, physician burnout costs the U.S. healthcare industry $4.6 billion per year due to lost productivity and higher turnover, with the cost of replacing a single physician estimated to be between $100,000 and $1 million. It is also adversely impacting productivity because the time spent by doctors on documentation could be spent on seeing more patients. Our mission is to enable doctors to practice medicine the way they want to by assuming the burden of documentation from them. Healthcare practitioners in the United States often look to outsourced solutions to handle their documentation. There are various solutions that are marketed to clinicians, which include licensed physicians, nurse practitioners and physicians’ assistants, but not registered nurses. These range in scope from self-serve dictation tools to comprehensive technology-enabled medical note documentation solutions. We are a provider of a comprehensive technology-enabled medical note documentation solution that also provides supplemental clinical support to the U.S. healthcare industry. Augmedix was incorporated in 2013 and launched its commercial real-time, remote documentation services in 2014. We provide software that is compatible with off-the-shelf mobile client devices (smartphones or Google Glass), which enables clinicians to communicate with our service platform, overseen by remotely located medical documentation specialists (each an “MDS”, and collectively “MDSs”). Our MDSs observe the clinician-patient interaction, through an audio/video stream, and extract the relevant elements of that interaction. Those elements are then used by our proprietary Notebuilder tool to automatically create sentences in the appropriate section of the medical note. Once completed, the medical notes are uploaded into the patient’s chart contained within the electronic health record (“EHR”) system. The EHR system is third-party software licensed by the healthcare clinic or system to manage patient charts. Patient care in the United States is provided in ambulatory or clinical environments and hospitals. We focus most of our efforts in the ambulatory/clinical segment of the patient care market. Roughly 85% of the physicians who subscribe to our service are employed directly by, or are affiliated with, a healthcare enterprise. The remaining 15% consists of small practices and individual practitioners. We have generated in excess of five million medical notes since we began offering our service and are currently delivering over 35,000 notes to our customers each week. We estimate that our solution saves doctors two to three hours each day which is time that they can redeploy to see more patients and/or improve their work-life balance. We believe the benefits to healthcare enterprises are increased productivity and higher clinician and patient satisfaction. To date, we provide service to four of the top 10 and six of the top 20 U.S. healthcare enterprises. The current COVID-19 pandemic and resulting safety protocols have prompted a significant shift towards delivering health services remotely via telemedicine. Our technology platform was designed to enable clinicians to engage our services even when they are conducting virtual patient visits. As such, we are able to continue to provide uninterrupted service to our customers, even when they are unable to see patients in their offices. We believe telemedicine will remain an important part of health services delivery even after the end of the COVID-19 pandemic.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company leveraging our novel targeted oncology platform to develop a potential new standard of care across multiple cancer indications, with an initial focus on ocular and urologic oncology. Our proprietary platform enables the targeting of a broad range of solid tumors using Virus-Like Particles, or VLPs, that can be conjugated with drugs or loaded with nucleic acids to create Virus-Like Drug Conjugates, or VDCs. Our VDCs are largely agnostic to tumor type and can recognize a surface marker, known as heparan sulfate proteoglycans, or HSPGs, that are specifically modified and broadly expressed on many tumors. AU-011, our first VDC candidate, is being developed for the first line treatment of primary choroidal melanoma, a rare disease with no drugs approved. We have completed a Phase 1b/2 trial using intravitreal administration that has demonstrated a statistically significant growth rate reduction in patients with prior active growth and high levels of tumor control with visual acuity preservation in a majority of patients, as assessed using clinical endpoints in alignment with feedback from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA. These data supported advancement into a Phase 2 dose escalation trial, where we are currently evaluating suprachoroidal, or SC, administration of AU-011. We plan to present six- to 12-month safety and efficacy data from this trial in 2022, and, if favorable, initiate a pivotal trial in the second half of 2022. We are also developing AU-011 for additional ocular oncology indications and plan to file an IND in the United States in second half of 2022 for choroidal metastases. Leveraging our VDCs’ broad tumor targeting capabilities, we also plan to initiate a Phase 1a trial in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, or NMIBC, our first non-ophthalmic solid tumor indication, in the second half of 2022 and present Phase 1a data from this trial in 2023. VDCs are a novel class of drugs with a dual mechanism of action that promotes cancer cell death by both the delivery of the cytotoxic payload to generate acute necrosis and by activating a secondary immune mediated response. VDCs are analogous to antibody-drug conjugates, or ADCs, another technology that employs a targeting moiety and a cytotoxic payload.
