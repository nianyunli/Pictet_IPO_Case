General Information,"(Note: This is the IPO – an offering of American Depositary Shares – by Oatly Group AB, the oatmilk company backed by a Blackstone Group fund whose celebrity investors, according to AFN, aka AgFunderNews, include Oprah Winfrey, Jay Z’s label Roc Nation, Oscar-winning actress Natalie Portman and former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. ) We have a bold vision for a food system that’s better for people and the planet. We are the world’s original and largest oatmilk company. For over 25 years, we have exclusively focused on developing expertise around oats: a global power crop with inherent properties suited for sustainability and human health. Our commitment to oats has resulted in core technical advancements that enabled us to unlock the breadth of the dairy portfolio, including milks, ice cream, yogurt, cooking creams, spreads and on-the-go drinks. Traditional food production is one of the biggest drivers of environmental impact. Food production uses about half of all habitable land on earth, requires large amounts of resources, emits greenhouse gases and harms biodiversity. At the same time, today’s food system—and often our eating habits—does not meet our nutritional needs, driving the prevalence of non-communicable diseases like malnutrition, obesity and heart and vascular diseases. Through our products and actions as a company, we work to grow the plant-based movement and help people shift from traditional dairy to plant-based products and enact positive societal and industry change. We believe that transforming the food industry is necessary to face humanity’s greatest challenges across climate, environment, health and lifestyle. In parallel, change is rocking the consumer landscape, as the growing concerns for the environment and interest in health and nutrition have started to drive real, scaled behavioral changes around consumer purchase choices. Generation Z and Millennials will become the dominant global generations in the coming years, bringing to the market a new set of values and expectations.

General Information,"We are a preclinical biopharmaceutical company developing next-generation therapeutics to improve the lives of patients suffering from inflammatory eye diseases and ocular pain. Our research program is focused on a novel G Protein-Coupled Receptor, or GPCR, which we believe plays a key role in the pathology of these inflammatory eye diseases of high unmet medical need. Our therapeutic approach is focused on targeting inflammatory and pain modulation pathways that drive these conditions. We are presently developing OK-101, our lead preclinical product candidate, for the treatment of dry-eye disease. We also plan to evaluate its potential in benefiting patients with ocular neuropathic pain, uveitis and allergic conjunctivitis. OK-101, our lead preclinical product candidate, is focused on keratoconjunctivitis sicca, commonly referred to as dry eye disease, or DED, which is a multifactorial disease caused by an underlying inflammation resulting in the lack of lubrication and moisture in the surface of the eye. DED is one of the most common ophthalmic conditions encountered in clinical practice. Symptoms of DED include constant discomfort and irritation accompanied by inflammation of the ocular surface, visual impairment and potential damage to the ocular surface. The disease affects over 35% of the population aged 50+, with women representing approximately two-thirds of those affected. Prevalence of DED is anticipated to increase substantially in the next 10-20 years due to aging populations in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China and use of contact lenses in the younger population. We believe this increase in prevalence of dry eye syndrome represents a major expanding economic burden to public healthcare. At present, there are essentially three major prescription drugs used to treat DED: 1) Restasis (cyclosporine), 2) Xiidra (lifitegrast), and 3) Tyrvaya (Varenicline). However, DED continues to be a major unmet medical need due to the large number of patients not well served by the treatments available to them through the medical community. **Note: Net loss is for the year ended March 31, 2021, according to the prospectus.",Pharmaceuticals - Ophthalmic,2,2007,Contact Information,Martello Court Admiral Park St. Peter Port Guernsey GY1 3HB,+44 (0)20 7495 2379,https://www.okyopharma.com/,"OKYO Pharma, Ltd.",Financial Information,,$0 mil (last 12 months),$-3.35 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,OKYO,NASDAQ,0.0,$0.00 - $0.00,$12.0 mil,ThinkEquity,-,,TBA,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of next-generation targeted therapies for women’s cancers. Our team has spent the past decade characterizing the structure and function of the estrogen receptor, or ER, a key driver of breast cancer in approximately 75% of patients, in order to develop more potent, oral therapies that completely inactivate this signaling pathway.  Our lead product candidate, OP-1250, is a novel oral therapy with combined activity as both a complete ER antagonist, or CERAN, and a selective ER degrader, or SERD, which we believe will drive deeper, more durable responses than existing therapies. OP-1250, both as a monotherapy and in combination with inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6, or CDK4/6, demonstrated robust tumor shrinkage in several xenograft models, including a breast cancer brain metastasis model. In August 2020, we initiated an ongoing Phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating OP-1250 for the treatment of recurrent, locally advanced or metastatic ER-positive, or ER+, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, or HER2-, breast cancer, and expect to report initial data from this trial in the second half of 2021. We own worldwide development and commercialization rights to OP-1250. Our plan is to develop OP-1250 in a number of ER+ breast cancer indications, both as a monotherapy and in combination with approved targeted therapies that have shown improved outcomes with other endocrine therapies. We believe OP-1250’s oral formulation and dual mechanism of action directly address the limitations of current endocrine therapies, such as fulvestrant and tamoxifen, and position OP-1250 as a potential endocrine therapy of choice for the treatment of ER+ breast cancers. Our goal is to transform the standard of care for women living with cancers by developing more effective therapies that apply our deep understanding and collective expertise in endocrine-driven cancers, nuclear receptor activities and mechanisms of acquired resistance.",Pharmaceuticals,10,2006,Contact Information,"512 2nd Street, 4th Floor San Francisco, California 94107",(415) 651-3316,http://www.olema.com/,Olema Pharmaceuticals,Financial Information,$637.8mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$-14.9 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,OLMA,NASDAQ,11.0,$19.00 - $19.00,$209.0 mil,J.P.

On Holding had raised its price range to $20 to $22 – up from $18 to $20 initially – and kept the number of shares the same at 31.1 million – in an F-1/A filing dated Sept. 13, 2021.) Tennis star Roger Federer is an investor in On Holding, a premium sports shoe and apparel company that he joined in 2019 as an active co-entrepreneur. While developing a competition tennis shoe, Roger suggested extending On’s patented technology to a tennis sneaker family to re-invent how age-old tennis sneakers are made. This is enriching our performance product offering and we believe Roger’s perspectives and insights as a professional athlete will help improve our product development, marketing and fan experiences. Our Performance Outdoor products embrace a new approach to taking on the mountains: light and fast, with shoes and outdoor apparel engineered to free you from the weight and bulk of traditional outdoor gear. On’s Origin Story: As a professional athlete, three-time World Champion and six-time Ironman Champion, Olivier Bernhard devoted himself to creating a running shoe that would give him the perfect running sensation. Olivier’s quest gave rise to the symbiosis of running experience and engineering expertise that would become On’s CloudTec technology. Dozens of prototypes were developed, but the basic concept – cushioned landing, explosive take-off – remained paramount throughout. It was this unique running sensation that convinced Olivier’s friends Caspar Coppetti and David Allemann to join Olivier in his quest. Together with Olivier, they formally established On in Zürich, Switzerland in January 2010. Just a month after the company was founded, early On prototypes won the ISPO Brand New Award, one of the most important prizes for innovation in sport. Test runners were enthusiastic and spoke of running on clouds. In July 2010, the first specialty running stores carried On shoes on their shelves. From these humble beginnings in Zürich, On set out in 2010 with a big ambition: to change the world of running for professionals and amateur runners alike. As On started to gain traction in several key markets, the three co-founders brought on Marc Maurer and Martin Hoffmann as equal partners in 2013 to scale and professionalize the business. Together, we have built a distinct culture that empowers the On team to make decisions and foster innovation, allowing On to rapidly scale while retaining the entrepreneurial mindset of a startup. We believe this partnership approach to leadership has been an integral part of On’s success over the past decade, and we expect it to continue. On is a premium performance sports brand rooted in technology, design and impact that has built a passionate global community of fans across more than 60 countries. We have a selective wholesale presence in approximately 8,100 premium retail doors globally and we generated 37.7% and 36.6% of our net sales in 2020 and the six-month period ended June 30, 2021, respectively, through our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channel, which is primarily driven by our website. We believe we are one of the fastest-growing scaled athletic sports companies in the world, having grown our net sales at an 85% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from inception through 2020 to CHF 425.3 million for the year ended Dec. 31, 2020. Our growth has continued in 2021, with net sales growing by 84.6% to CHF 315.5 million for the six-month period ended June 30, 2021 compared to the six-month period ended June 30, 2020. As a Swiss company with a small home market, we opted to expand globally from the very beginning, and today we have a fast-growing presence across a number of international markets including, among others, Germany (first entered in 2011), the United States (2013), Japan (2013), China (2018) and Brazil (2018). We believe this global presence within the large global footwear and apparel market positions us well for future growth. **Note: For the first six months of 2021 (ending June 30, 2021), On Holding reported net income of 3.8 million Swiss francs (US$4.14 million) on net sales of 315.5 million Swiss francs (US$344.01 million).",Rubber & Plastic Footwear,883,2010,Contact Information,Pfingstweidstrasse 106 8005 Zürich Switzerland +41 44 225 15 55,+41 44 225 15 55,http://www.on-running.com/,On Holding AG,Financial Information,$14798.9mil,$731.89 mil (last 12 months),$ mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,ONON,NYSE,31.1,$24.00 - $24.00,$746.4 mil,Goldman Sachs/ Morgan Stanley/ J.P.

We believe our management team’s extensive investment and operational experience allows us to evaluate targets in industries such as food production, which includes aquaculture and seafood, sustainable consumer-facing products, logistics, technology, such as hardware, software, networks and e-platforms, agriculture and energy, which includes underlying renewable technologies, utility services, energy efficiency and management, among others. Furthermore, our target universe could include companies undergoing a transition to increase their environmental sustainability profiles, reflecting an opportunity to bring environmentally sustainable practices to companies that may not have historically been focused on environmental sustainability.

General Information,"(Note: This is not an IPO, although the company says this is its IPO of American Depositary Shares (ADS) in the United States. From the prospectus: Each ADS represents represents eight ordinary shares. Our ordinary shares are listed on the Australian Securities Exchange under the symbol “OPT.” On Oct. 8, 2020, the last reported sale price of our ordinary shares on the Australian Securities Exchange was equivalent to a price of US$17.26 per ADS, after giving effect to the Australian dollar/U.S. dollar exchange rate of A$1.3996 to US$1.00 as of Oct. 8, 2020, and an ADS-to-ordinary share ratio of 1-to-8. **Revenue and loss figures are in A$ for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020.) We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel therapy for the treatment of highly prevalent and progressive retinal diseases. We are developing our Phase 3-ready product candidate, OPT-302, a biologic designed to inhibit VEGF-C and VEGF-D, to complement VEGF-A inhibitors for the treatment of ophthalmic diseases. Anti-VEGF-A therapies represent the standard of care for wet age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, and other retinal diseases; however, there remains a significant unmet medical need as many patients do not adequately respond to these treatments. As the only biologic inhibitor of VEGF-C and VEGF-D in clinical development, OPT-302 differs from standard of care therapies and when administered in combination with a VEGF-A inhibitor, is designed to achieve broader inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, family and target a mechanism of clinical resistance to improve visual acuity.  Our lead indication for OPT-302 combination therapy is wet AMD, a chronic, progressive disease and the leading cause of vision loss for individuals over the age of 50. In a 366-patient Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of wet AMD, 2.0 mg OPT-302, in combination with a standard of care anti-VEGF-A therapy, ranibizumab (Lucentis), met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant superior mean gain in visual acuity over ranibizumab monotherapy at week 24. We intend to initiate two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in treatment-naive patients with wet AMD to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OPT-302 in combination with anti-VEGF-A therapies compared to anti-VEGF-A monotherapy in the first half of 2021. We expect to report topline data from these Phase 3 clinical trials in 2023. In addition to our clinical trials in wet AMD, we have observed evidence of improved clinical outcomes in a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of OPT-302 in combination with another standard of care anti-VEGF-A therapy, aflibercept (Eylea), in patients with treatment-refractory diabetic macular edema, or DME. We retain worldwide rights to develop and commercialize OPT-302 for the treatment of wet AMD and DME and believe that the novel treatment mechanism of OPT-302 has the potential to provide therapeutic benefit for other progressive eye diseases.",BIOLOGICAL PRODUCTS (NO DIAGNOSTIC SUBSTANCES),8,1984,Contact Information,"Level 4 650 Chapel Street South Yarra, Victoria 3141 Australia",+ 61 3 9826 0399,http://www.opthea.com,Opthea Limited,Financial Information,,$0.09 mil (last 12 months),$-16.5 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,OPT,NASDAQ,8.6,$13.50 - $13.50,$116.6 mil,Citigroup/ SVB Leerink,Oppenheimer & Co./ Truist Securities,10/16/2020,Priced,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,

We believe this experience to be a substantial competitive advantage in the current economic environment relative to other blank check companies and sources of capital. The recent novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has had an unprecedented impact on Consumer, Retail and Leisure companies, including companies with high levels of brand equity, above average returns on invested capital and healthy growth rates. Many of these companies are leveraged due to private equity ownership or M&A transactions underwritten with significant amounts of unrealized synergies.
