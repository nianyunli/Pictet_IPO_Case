General Information,"We are a biotechnology company committed to democratizing healthcare across the globe. Our vision is to disrupt the existing treatment paradigm for chronic diseases, increasingly dominated by drugs, particularly monoclonal antibodies (“mAbs”), which suffer from prohibitive costs and cumbersome administration. We believe our synthetic peptide vaccine platform (“Vaxxine Platform”) has the potential to enable a new class of therapeutics that will improve the quality and convenience of care, reduce costs and increase access to treatments for a wide range of indications. Our Vaxxine Platform is designed to harness the immune system to convert the body into its own “drug factory,” stimulating the production of antibodies with a therapeutic or protective effect. While traditional vaccines have been able to leverage this approach against infectious diseases, they have historically been unable to resolve key challenges in the fight against chronic diseases. Our current pipeline consists of five chronic disease product candidates from early to late-stage development across multiple therapeutic areas, including Alzheimer’s Disease (“AD”), Parkinson’s Disease (“PD”), migraine and hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, we believe our Vaxxine Platform may be used to disrupt the treatment paradigm for a wide range of other chronic diseases, including any that are or could potentially be successfully treated by mAbs. We also will opportunistically pursue infectious disease treatments. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck the world in March 2020, we quickly reallocated our resources to develop vaccine candidates for the condition.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing new therapies for millions of patients living with inflammatory diseases and autoimmune disorders. We believe our ability to discover and develop differentiated product candidates in an efficient manner allows us to address substantial commercial markets and positions us to become a leader in the immunology market. Our lead product candidate is VTX958, an oral, selective clinical-stage tyrosine kinase type 2 (TYK2) inhibitor. VTX958 is designed to selectively inhibit TYK2 without detectable inhibition of other Janus kinase (JAK) isoforms, which as observed in preclinical studies, supports the potential to avoid toxicities associated with broader JAK inhibition and, thus, other JAK inhibitors. We believe VTX958 has the potential to address a broad range of immune-mediated diseases, such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), psoriatic arthritis and lupus, each of which represent substantial market opportunities.

Based on these data, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in the second half of 2021 to pursue the commercial opportunity in UC, which represented approximately $7 billion in worldwide sales in 2020. We also are developing a comprehensive portfolio of differentiated NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inhibitors to address multiple indications driven by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Our oral, selective and peripherally restricted (does not cross the blood-brain barrier) NLRP3 inhibitor, VTX2735, has been designed to treat systemic inflammatory diseases, such as cardiovascular, hepatic, renal and rheumatologic diseases. In addition to VTX2735, our portfolio of NLRP3 compounds includes CNS-penetrant inhibitors, which we believe have potential therapeutic utility for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and MS, based on preclinical and clinical evidence underscoring the pathogenic role of NLRP3 in these neurodegenerative diseases.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing transformative treatments for patients with serious immunological diseases. Our lead product candidate is atacicept, a fusion protein self-administered as a subcutaneous injection once weekly that blocks both B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), which stimulate B cells and plasma cells to produce autoantibodies contributing to certain autoimmune diseases. We are conducting a Phase 2b clinical trial of atacicept in patients with immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN), a disease with a high unmet medical need and no approved therapies. IgAN is a serious and progressive autoimmune disease of the kidney that is driven by the production of immunogenic galactose-deficient IgA1 (Gd-IgA1). IgAN patients with elevated Gd-IgA1 are at increased risk of kidney-related morbidity and mortality. As reported in a Phase 2a clinical trial of 16 patients conducted by Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, atacicept is the first and only molecule currently in development to demonstrate a 60% reduction in plasma Gd-IgA1 in IgAN patients (75 mg dose, n=4 at 24 weeks), which we believe can be disease modifying. We plan to initiate patient screening for our Phase 2b clinical trial in IgAN in the second quarter of 2021, and we expect to report topline results in the fourth quarter of 2022. In addition, we are evaluating additional diseases where atacicept’s reduction of autoantibodies may prove medically useful, including lupus nephritis (LN), a severe renal manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

General Information,"We are a genetic medicines company pioneering a new approach to the care of cardiovascular disease, or CVD, transforming treatment from chronic management to single-course gene editing medicines. Despite advances in treatment over the last 50 years, CVD remains the leading cause of death worldwide. The current paradigm of chronic care is fragile—requiring rigorous patient adherence, extensive healthcare infrastructure and regular healthcare access—and leaves many patients without adequate care. Our goal is to disrupt the chronic care model for CVD by providing a new therapeutic approach with single-course in vivo gene editing treatments focused on addressing the root causes of this highly prevalent and life-threatening disease. Our initial two programs target PCSK9 and ANGPTL3, respectively, genes that have been extensively validated as targets for lowering blood lipids, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL-C. We believe that editing these genes could potently and durably lower LDL-C throughout the lifetime of patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, or ASCVD, the most common form of CVD.

General Information,"We are a microglia-focused company dedicated to improving the lives of patients, caregivers and families affected by rare and common neurodegenerative diseases by pursuing the development of disease-modifying therapeutics to restore the vigilance of microglia. Microglia are the sentinel immune cells of the brain and play a critical role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) health and responding to damage caused by disease. Leveraging recent research implicating microglial dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases, we utilize a precision medicine approach to develop a pipeline of therapeutic candidates, initially addressing genetically defined patient subpopulations, that we believe will activate and restore microglial function. Our first therapeutic candidates are designed to activate Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2), a key microglial receptor protein that mediates responses to environmental signals in order to maintain brain health and whose dysfunction is linked to neurodegeneration. We are initially developing our lead product candidate, VGL10, for the treatment of adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), a rare, genetically defined, and fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by microglial dysfunction. We intend to expand development of VGL101 for the treatment of additional rare leukoencephalopathies and leukodystrophies in which microglia play an essential role, including cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD). Our lead candidate, VGL101, is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that is designed to activate TREM2. In November 2021, the FDA cleared our Investigational New Drug application (IND) for VGL101 in ALSP at doses up to 20 mg/kg. We initiated our first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial with VGL101 in healthy volunteers in December 2021 and expect to announce topline data in the second half of 2022. We are also developing a novel small molecule TREM2 agonist suitable for oral delivery to treat common neurodegenerative diseases associated with microglial dysfunction. The initial focus of our novel small molecule TREM2 agonist program is for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in genetically defined patient subpopulations. We expect to select a development candidate by the first quarter of 2022 and, following IND-enabling studies, plan to initiate a first-in-human healthy volunteer trial. We believe our microglia focus, precision medicine approach, and pipeline, which spans multiple modalities, strongly position us to become a differentiated leader in the neurodegenerative therapeutic space.

General Information,"We are an energy company focused on the development of natural gas properties in the stacked Haynesville and Mid-Bossier shale plays in the Haynesville Basin of Northwest Louisiana. Natural gas demand has significantly grown as a percentage of North America’s energy mix over the last 10 years, having increased 38% from 86 Bcfd to 119 Bcfd and growing from 27% to 37% of the energy mix due to ample domestic supply, reliability of supply, significant supporting in-place infrastructure, low carbon intensity and low prices.

Our mission is to minimize the risks of viruses throughout the world via our products offerings. We intend to apply for an aggregate of 4 patents in 2022. For one of the pending patents, we are in the process of acquiring it and we expect to close the acquisition in 2022. Further, we are developing a T-Cell IVD test kit under the Virax Immune brand for COVID-19 initially, which we subsequently intend to adapt for immunological profiling against multiple viral threats. We are also building a proprietary mobile application for Virax Immune, using an in-house code, that will present an individual’s immunological profiling data and provide advice on the users’ immune system. Based on our management team’s analysis, we expect to file a patent for the Virax Immune Cell diagnostic test kit and a copyright for the Virax Immune app in 2022. Our product portfolio includes: (i) diagnostics test kits sold through our “ViraxClear” brand; (ii) med-tech and PPE products sold through our “ViraxCare” brand; and (iii) sourced brands of third party suppliers, independent of our own brands (“Sourced Brands”). We also expect to launch an upcoming brand “Virax Immune”, with the intention of providing an immunology profiling platform that assesses each individual’s immune risk profile against major global viral diseases. We believe that the T-Cell in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) Tests and immunology platform we are developing under the Virax Immune brand will be particularly useful in the diagnosis and threat analysis of the major viruses faced globally.

General Information,"We are an all-electric, off-road powersports vehicle company developing and building electric two and four-wheel motorcycles and utility terrain vehicles (UTVs), also known as side-by-sides, along with a complete line of upgrades and accessories. In October 2020, we began building and testing prototypes for our future offerings with two off-road motorcycles – the Grunt and the Runt. We are currently taking orders on our website for these initial offerings and expect to begin delivering the Grunt in the third quarter of 2021 and the Runt in the first quarter of 2022. Also in 2022, we expect to expand our offerings with the Volcon Stag, a UTV, followed in 2023 by a higher performance, longer range UTV called the Beast. We initially intend to sell and distribute our vehicles and accessories in the U.S. on a direct-to-consumer sales platform. We are currently negotiating dealership agreements with retail partners to display and sell our vehicles and accessories. Once we have dealers in each state, customers can either purchase a vehicle and accessories through our website and pick them up at a local dealership, or they can buy them directly from a local dealership. Some of these retail partners will also provide warranty and repair services to our customers. To date, we have not entered into any dealership agreements. As of September 1, 2021, U.S. customers have made deposits for 278 Grunts and 5 Runts, plus accessories and a delivery fee representing total deposits of $1.8 million. These orders are cancelable by the customer until the vehicle is delivered and after a 14-day acceptance period, therefore the deposits have been recorded as deferred revenue. Based on our current production capacity, we believe we will deliver all the Grunts by November 2021 and the Runts by the first quarter of 2022. Our vehicles and accessories will be sold globally in a three-phase rollout of export sales– Latin America importers in 2021, Canada, Europe, and Africa in 2022 and Southeast Asia plus Australia in 2023. Export sales are executed with individual importers in each country that buy vehicles by the container. Each importer will sell vehicles to local dealers or directly to customers. Local dealers will provide warranty and repair services for vehicles purchased in their country. *For the six months that ended June 30, 2021, Volcon had a net loss of $19.46 million.

General Information,"Vor Biopharma’s mission is to develop transformative treatments for patients suffering from hematological malignancies. We are a clinical-stage cell therapy company combining a novel patient engineering approach with targeted therapies to provide a single company solution for patients suffering from hematological malignancies. For many patients, the only way to achieve durable remission or a cure is through hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Despite undergoing HSCT, about 40% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients relapse and face an extremely poor prognosis, with two-year survival rates of less than 20%. We are developing our lead eHSC product candidate, VOR33, and our companion therapeutic, VCAR33, which together, we believe, have the potential to transform the treatment paradigm for AML and other hematological malignancies. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our Investigational New Drug (IND) application for VOR33 in January 2021, and we intend to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1/2a trial of VOR33 in AML patients in combination with Mylotarg, an FDA-approved CD33-directed therapy owned by Pfizer, in the first half of 2021. We expect initial data from this trial to be reported in late 2021 or in the first half of 2022. We use gene editing to remove cancer drug targets from healthy cells to protect the patient’s bone marrow from the cancer treatment’s toxicity. VOR33 consists of hematopoietic stem cells engineered to lack the CD33 protein; this is a cell therapy candidate intended to replace the HSCT standard of care for AML patients at high risk for relapse. (eHSC stands for engineered hematopoietic stem cell.)
