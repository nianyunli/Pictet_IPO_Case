General Information,"We are an innovative biopharmaceutical company developing next-generation therapeutics based on our proprietary Tumor Activated T Cell Engager (TRACTr) platform technology to better treat patients suffering from cancer. Our initial focus is on developing a novel class of T cell engagers (TCEs), and our lead product candidates are designed to target clinically validated drug targets. While TCE therapeutics have displayed potent anti-tumor activity in hematological cancers, developing TCEs to treat solid tumors has faced challenges due to the limitations of prior TCE technologies, namely (i) overactivation of the immune system leading to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), (ii) on-target, healthy tissue toxicities and (iii) poor pharmacokinetics (PK) leading to short half-life. Our lead TRACTr product candidates are designed to target PSMA, EGFR, and TROP2. Each of these tumor targets are clinically validated and implicated in solid tumors with high prevalence, including metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), colorectal cancer (CRC), squamous cell cancer of the head and neck (SCCHN), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), urothelial cancer (UC), and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

General Information,"This IPO marks JOANN Inc.’s return to the public markets for the first time since 2011, when it was bought by private equity company Leonard Green & Partners. The company was formerly known as Jo-Ann Stores Holdings Inc. JOANN is the nation’s category leader in sewing and one of the fastest-growing players in the arts and crafts category. The Creative Products industry is a large and growing market, which according to a 2017 Association for Creative Industries (AFCI) study is in excess of $40 billion. The industry is currently experiencing a significant acceleration for product demand in response to multiple secular themes that have been further solidified during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as heightened DIY customer behavior, amplified participation from both new and existing customers and increased digital engagement, of which we are a key beneficiary because we have positioned ourselves and our go-forward strategies to capitalize on increased demand for Creative Products. As a well-established and trusted brand for over 75 years, we believe we have a deep understanding of our customers, what inspires their creativity and what fuels their incredibly diverse projects. Since 2016, we have embarked on a strategy to transform JOANN, which has helped us pivot from a traditional retailer to a fully integrated, digitally connected provider of Creative Products. Our momentum through the COVID-19 pandemic has been further supported by heightened DIY customer behavior, significant increases in the number of new and current customers participating in new categories and the continued rise of online marketplaces. As a result, according to Earnest Research, we and the other two largest specialty players in the Creative Products industry have seen on average 22% growth in year-over-year sales since May 3, 2020. (Note: Revenue and net income figures are for the 39 weeks that ended Oct. 31, 2020, according to the prospectus. The company reported $1,921.5 million – or $1.92 billion – in net sales and net income of $174.0 million for the 39 weeks that ended Oct. 31, 2020, compared with year-ago figures of $1,545.6 million – or $1.55 billion – in net sales and a net loss of $188.5 million for the 39 weeks that ended Oct. 31, 2019.)
