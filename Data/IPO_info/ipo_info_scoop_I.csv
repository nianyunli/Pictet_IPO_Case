General Information,"We are a biopharmaceutical company leveraging our innovative virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology to develop vaccines against infectious diseases, with an initial focus on life-threatening respiratory diseases. Our VLP platform technology is designed to enable multivalent, particle-based display of complex viral antigens, which we believe will induce broad, robust and durable protection against the specific viruses targeted.  Our pipeline includes vaccine candidates targeting some of the most prevalent viral causes of pneumonia. We are developing these candidates for older adults, a patient population with high unmet need. Our vaccine candidate IVX-A12 is a bivalent candidate, or a mixture of two different VLP candidates. IVX-A12 combines IVX-121, a vaccine candidate designed to target respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and IVX-241, a vaccine candidate designed to target human metapneumovirus (hMPV). There are currently no vaccines approved for either RSV or hMPV, which are two common causes of pneumonia in older adults. We filed a clinical trial application (CTA) for IVX-121 with the regulatory authority in Belgium (FAMHP) in June 2021 and plan to initiate a clinical trial of IVX-121 in the second half 2021, with topline data expected in the first half of 2022. Assuming favorable results from the IVX-121 clinical trial and favorable preclinical data for IVX-241, we plan to submit an investigational new drug application (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2022 and, thereafter, initiate a clinical trial of our combination vaccine candidate, IVX-A12. Additionally, we are developing two severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccine candidates, IVX-411 and IVX-421, and initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of IVX-411 in Australia in June 2021, with proof-of-concept data expected in the first half of 2022. We believe that our pipeline and platform can deliver a meaningful impact globally in preventing life-threatening infectious diseases. Note: We have not generated any revenue from the sale of our products. We were awarded a $10 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)on Sept. 24, 2020, to develop the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

General Information,"We, supported by our e-commerce trading platform, are primarily engaged in sales of electronic component products to customers in Hong Kong and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). These products are primarily used by China-based small and medium-sized enterprises (“SMEs”) in the consumer electronic industry, Internet of Things (“IoT”), automotive electronics and industry control segment. In addition to the sales of electronic component products, we also provide services to customers such as temporary warehousing, logistic and shipping, and customs clearance and charge them additional service commission fees. We sell two categories of electronic component products: (i) semiconductor products and (ii) electronic equipment, tools and other products. Our semiconductor products primarily include various integrated circuit, discretes, passive components and optoelectronics, and our equipment, tools and other electronic component products primarily include various electromechanical, maintenance, repair & operations (“MRO”), and various design tools. Note: We are not a Chinese operating company, but a holding company incorporated in the Cayman Islands with all of our operations conducted by our wholly owned subsidiaries established in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC” or “China”) and Hong Kong. This structure involves unique risks to investors. See “Risk Factor — Risks Related to Doing Business in China” starting on page 50 of this prospectus and “Risk Factor — Risks Related to Our Corporate Structure” starting on page 48 of this prospectus. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we made purchases from a total of 966 suppliers. As the date hereof, we have uploaded information of all products we purchased not only from those suppliers but from any new suppliers in 2022 on the new platform. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, we generated revenue from a total of 1,049 customers through the old platform. The new platform, however, does not automatically integrate the information of registered customers from the old platform. The customers are mainly small-medium electronic component buyers in PRC, some of which are repeat customers who constantly place orders on the platform, and some are less active who place orders whenever they need to. For those repeat customers, we were able to contact them and worked with them even prior to the termination of the VIE arrangement to register with the new platform and continue working with them to transfer over to the new platform. For other random customers, with the assistance from Pai Ming Shenzhen, we are gradually transferring them over. See more details about the cooperation with Pai Ming Shenzhen described in this prospectus. We currently expect that it will take us up to one year to complete the transfer of customers. In January and February 2022, we had 427 customers, among which 382 were transferred customers and 45 were new customers (including 9 new customers sourced by Pai Ming Shenzhen). **Note: For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, our revenue was $279.36 million, and our net income was $2.63 million.

General Information,"We are a targeted oncology company focused on developing novel cancer therapies targeting key signaling pathways that drive the formation and spread of cancer. Since we commenced operations in 2016, we have discovered or developed five oncology programs that include four product candidates in either IND-enabling studies or clinical development. Our lead targeted oncology product candidate is IK-930, an oral small molecule inhibitor of the TEAD, transcription factor in the Hippo signaling pathway – a factor in about 10 percent of all cancers. We plan to focus on mesothelioma and soft tissue sarcomas. We intend to submit an IND application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for IK-930 in the second half of 2021. For our second targeted oncology program, we discovered and plan to develop oral small molecule inhibitors of extracellular signal-related kinase 5, or ERK5, a downstream enzyme in the RAS signaling pathway. We anticipate submitting an IND for an ERK5 development product candidate in the second half of 2022. In addition to our targeted oncology programs, we have three product candidates designed to modulate the tumor microenvironment in specific patient populations by leveraging biomarker-driven patient enrichment strategies. Two of these product candidates, IK-175 and IK-412, are partnered with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS: IK-175, for which we are enrolling patients with bladder cancer in a clinical trial, and IK-412, an enzyme therapy designed to lower levels of immunosuppressive kynurenine in the tumor microenvironment.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company discovering and developing small molecule product candidates that target lysine-specific demethylase 1, or LSD1, an enzyme that plays a central role in the production of blood cells in the bone marrow. We are focused on improving the quality of life of patients with cancer and bone marrow diseases in addition to prolonging their lives. Our lead product candidate is bomedemstat for the treatment of certain myeloproliferative neoplasms, or MPNs, a family of related chronic cancers of the bone marrow. The three most common MPNs are myelofibrosis, or MF, essential thrombocythemia, or ET, and polycythemia vera, or PV. We are currently enrolling patients in a Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat for the treatment of ET and have completed enrollment for a Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat for the treatment of MF. In our Phase 2 clinical trial in ET through May 18, 2021, interim and unaudited data from 28 patients demonstrates that a significant proportion of patients achieved a platelet count in the normal range within eight weeks. In our Phase 2 clinical trial in MF through May 17, 2021, interim and unaudited data from 86 patients demonstrates that bomedemstat has resulted in improvements in patient symptoms, reductions in spleen volume and reduction in mutant allele frequency, or MAF, the proportion of blood cells with mutations that drive this disease. We believe bomedemstat has the potential to address unmet medical need in MF as a monotherapy as well as in combination with inhibitors of Janus-associated kinase. Bomedemstat has been generally well-tolerated in both ET and MF patients in these trials. We are pursuing the development of bomedemstat as a potentially disease-modifying therapy in ET and MF to address the limitations of currently approved therapies. Based on the current rate of enrollment for the Phase 2 clinical trial in ET, we expect to receive FDA clearance for a registrational Phase 3 clinical trial for ET in 2022, with the first patient dosed thereafter. In addition, in 2021, we expect to support an investigator-sponsored Phase 2 clinical trial of bomedemstat in combination with ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with MF.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a novel class of Tissue-Specific Therapeutics (“TSTx”)TM in oncology and inflammation. Our lead product candidate, IMX-110, is currently in Phase 1b/2a clinical trials for solid tumors in the United States and Australia. IMX-110 is a negatively-charged TSTx that simultaneously disables resistance pathways with a poly-kinase inhibitor (which inhibits multiple kinases simultaneously), and induces tumor cell death with an apoptosis inducer (which activates apoptosis, a non-inflammatory programmed cell death pathway), leveraging our TME NormalizationTM Technology, delivered deep into the tumor micro-environment (“TME”). Our proprietary System Multi-Action RegulaTors SMARxT Tissue-SpecificTM Platform produces drugs that accumulate at intended therapeutic sites at 3-5 times the rate of conventional medicines. Our TME Normalization™ Technology allows our drug candidates to circulate in the bloodstream, exit through tumor blood vessels and simultaneously attack all components of the TME. As of the date of this prospectus, we have not generated any revenues. Since inception, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing product and technology rights, conducting research and development, organizing and staffing our Company, business planning and raising capital.  As of September 2021, we have treated 14 patients in our ongoing Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in the United States and Australia. 100% of these patients received between 3 and 13 lines of therapy prior to IMX-110. Zero drug-related serious adverse events and zero dose interruptions due to toxicity have been observed in our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial to date. In our trial, we observed radiological progression-free-survival of 6 months in 50% of our STS patients, with a 4-month median progression free survival (“mPFS”) across all STS patients. mPFS is the time that patients live without their cancer progressing. The trial includes patients with leiomyosarcoma, carcinosarcoma, poorly differentiated soft tissue sarcoma, cholangiocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer and nasopharyngeal cancer. In August 2021, we entered into a Clinical Collaboration and Supply Agreement with BeiGene Ltd. (“BeiGene”) for a combination Phase 1b clinical trial in solid tumors of IMX-110 and anti-PD-1 Tislelizumab (the subject of a collaboration and license agreement among BeiGene and Novartis). In genetic mouse models of pancreatic cancer, IMX-110 has demonstrated an immunomodulation effect, turning “cold” tumors “hot,” and, in combination with murine anti-PD-1, IMX-110 produced extended survival versus multi-drug combinations. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential for TSTx to be an integral component of combination therapies for a wide range of advanced solid tumors. In September 2021, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted Orphan Drug Designation (“ODD”) to IMX-110 for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma. If a product that has ODD subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusive approval (or exclusivity), which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years (except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity).

From the prospectus: “We are a biopharmaceutical company with an emerging pipeline focused on improving patient outcomes across a spectrum of debilitating oncologic and neurologic diseases by applying our deep knowledge of translational bioinformatics to every stage of the drug development process. We have more than a decade of experience in translational bioinformatics and generating insights into drug mechanisms of action and patient treatment responses. Building on this experience, we developed a disease-agnostic platform that enables us to utilize human data, novel biology and chemistry, and translational planning to create and advance our wholly owned pipeline. Our current development programs in oncology are focused on providing treatments for patients with solid tumors caused by mutations of the MAPK pathway and other oncologic signaling pathways. “Our lead product candidate, IMM-1-104, is designed to be a highly selective dual-MEK inhibitor that further disrupts KSR for the treatment of advanced solid tumors in patients harboring RAS mutant tumors. We plan to submit an IND for IMM-1-104 to the FDA in the first quarter of 2022.

General Information,"We are a late-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of a novel class of TCR (T cell receptor) bispecific immunotherapies called ImmTAX – Immune mobilizing monoclonal TCRs Against X disease – designed to treat a broad range of diseases, including cancer, infectious and autoimmune. Leveraging our proprietary, flexible, off-the-shelf ImmTAX platform, we are developing a deep pipeline in multiple therapeutic areas, including five clinical stage programs in oncology and infectious disease, advanced pre-clinical programs in autoimmune disease and multiple earlier pre-clinical programs. To date, we have dosed over 600 cancer patients with our ImmTAX product candidates, which we believe is the largest clinical data set of any bispecific in a solid tumor and any TCR therapeutic. Our clinical programs are being conducted with patients with a broad range of cancers, including lung, bladder, gastric, head and neck and ovarian, among others.

General Information,"We are a biopharmaceutical company utilizing our proprietary human memory B cell platform to discover and develop first-in-class antibody therapeutics designed to change the way diseases are currently being treated. Our proprietary discovery platform identifies novel therapeutic antibodies and their targets by leveraging highly educated components of the immune system, memory B cells, from patients who have learned to fight off their disease. Our platform is differentiated from those of other biotechnology companies because of our unbiased, broad, deep and efficient approach to identifying novel antibody-target pairs that may be useful in treating cancer and infectious diseases. To date, we have processed more than 150 cancer patient memory B cell samples and have generated and screened more than 250,000 hybridomas, or forms of B cell clones, produced by fusion with an immortal partner cell line. The resulting immortalized hybrid cells produce a single antibody for extended periods of time, and we have successfully identified approximately 1,200 individual antibodies, which we refer to as hits, that appear to bind either a cancer cell or a tumor extract with high-affinity and specificity. One of these unique targets is interleukin-38, or IL-38, a small protein, secreted by various cells of the body, which appears to function as a novel immune checkpoint inhibitor, and is the current focus of our lead discovery program, IMM-ONC-01.

Our sdAb platform allows us to pursue validated targets with clinical promise, but where other antibody and biologic based approaches have failed. Highly modular, our sdAbs can be combined with precise valencies and multiple specificities, creating therapeutic candidates designed to be capable of enhanced cell signaling, conditional activation or combined synergistic functions. We currently have four programs in ongoing Phase 1 clinical trials, three for the treatment of various cancers, and one for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency, or AATD. Our most advanced therapeutic candidate, INBRX-109, is a tetravalent death receptor 5, or DR5, agonist being evaluated in patients diagnosed with chondrosarcoma and mesothelioma, two difficult-to-treat cancers. INBRX-106 is a hexavalent OX40 agonist currently being investigated in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Both INBRX-109 and INBRX-106 programs are designed to achieve target agonism through precise control of therapeutic valency. INBRX‑105 targets two proteins, each of which can lead to an enhanced anti-tumor immune response; it is engineered with the goal of improving safety through conditional target agonism.

General Information,"(Note: This IPO is a small-cap unit offering on the NASDAQ. IPOScoop has NO CALL on unit offering IPOS, other than SPACs.) Innovative Eyewear develops and sells cutting-edge eyeglasses and sunglasses, which are designed to allow our customers to remain connected to their digital lives, while also offering prescription eyewear and sun protection. The company was founded by Lucyd Ltd. (the “Parent”), a portfolio company of Tekcapital. Based in the U.K., Tekcapital is a university intellectual property accelerator. Tekcapital builds portfolio companies around new technologies. Innovative Eyewear licensed the exclusive rights to the Lucyd® brand from Lucyd Ltd., which includes the exclusive use of all of Lucyd Ltd.’s intellectual property, including our main product, Lucyd Lyte® glasses. In January 2021, Innovative Eyewear fully launched its first commercial product, Lucyd Lyte. This initial product embodies our goal of creating smart eyewear for all day wear that looks like and is priced similarly to designer eyewear, but is also lightweight and comfortable, and enables the wearer to remain connected to their digital lives. The product was initially launched with six styles. In September 2021, an additional six styles were added. These 12 styles are each available with 56 different lens types, resulting in 668 variations of products currently available. Lucyd Lyte glasses enable the wearer to listen to music, take and make calls, and use voice assistants to perform many common smartphone tasks hands-free. (“Upgrade Your Eyewear”). We also believe that traditional frames, no matter how attractive, do not possess the functionality many eyeglass wearers need and want. Smart eyewear is part of a fast-growing technology-enhanced ecosystem, consisting of traditional eyewear, electronic in-ear devices (“hearables”) and digital assistants. We believe smart eyewear should also enable customers to freely interact with social media. While digital assistants, once enabled, can provide some of this interaction, we believe that the ability to receive and send social media posts with your voice will greatly enhance ease of use of these platforms on the go. To facilitate this, Innovative Eyewear has developed a full stack social media application called Vyrb™ which enables the user to receive and send posts through Lucyd Lyte smart glasses with your voice. The application launched out of beta in December 2021, and we are aiming to roll out software upgrades to Vyrb in the fourth quarter of 2022, which are currently planned to include new features like: monetization, ad-buying modules, an itemized upgrade system and content selling capabilities for social media creators.

General Information,"We are a specialty medical device company engaged in the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of proprietary respiratory support technology that is intended to provide an alternative to invasive mechanical ventilation, or MV, which is the standard of care today for the treatment of respiratory failure. Although it may be lifesaving, MV is associated with increased costs of care, extended lengths of stay in the hospital, frequent incidence of infections, ventilator dependence and mortality. The COVID-19 pandemic has further exposed the weaknesses and disadvantages of invasive MV that has both high association with considerable medical risks and iatrogenic complications, which further burdens the healthcare system with long hospital stays and high costs of treatment. We have developed a direct blood oxygenation technology called Augmented Respiration Technology, or ART. Our device, the ART500, is comprised of a minimally invasive, portable dual lumen cannula which is inserted into the jugular vein and utilizes our extra-corporeal direct blood oxygenation unit to elevate and stabilize declining oxygen saturation levels. The ART500’s structure provides the potential to extend respiratory treatment beyond ICU environments, making acute respiratory treatment available in regions and medical facilities without the need for ICUs. Our ART500 is designed to treat patients while awake, mobile and breathing spontaneously. Although our ART500 has not been tested in humans, and is not cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, or similar foreign regulatory bodies, we believe that our ART500 has the potential to reduce the patients’ length of stay in the ICU, as well as to reduce the rehabilitation period in the hospital due to the absence of the need to wean the patients after MV intubation that requires medically induced coma, and reduce the incidence of hospital re-admissions compared to MV.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing an innovative cell therapy pipeline of autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocyte, or TIL, therapies to treat patients with cancer. We are advancing our lead TIL product candidate, ITIL-168, to treat advanced melanoma. We plan to submit an investigational new drug (IND) application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and, if authorized to proceed, initiate a Phase 2 trial in the second half of 2021. We anticipate obtaining topline safety and efficacy data in 2023. This Phase 2 trial, if successful, has the potential to support a biologics license application (BLA) submission in 2023. We plan to initiate Phase 1 trials of ITIL-168 in additional indications with unmet medical need, including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and cervical cancer, in the first half of 2022. ITIL-168 will be manufactured in our company-operated facilities for our clinical trials and commercial sale, if approved. We are also developing a novel class of genetically engineered TIL therapies using our Co-Stimulatory Antigen Receptor, or CoStAR, platform. These modified TILs still rely on their native patient-specific T cell receptors (TCRs) to bind to tumor neoantigens, but have been enhanced to express novel CoStAR molecules, which bind to shared tumor-associated antigens and provide potent costimulation to T cells within the microenvironment. This approach has the potential to bring TIL therapy to patients with cancer types that have been historically resistant to immunotherapy.

General Information,"Our mission is to enable professional and financial services firms to better connect their people, processes, and data through AI-powered software solutions. Intapp is a leading provider of industry-specific, cloud-based software solutions for the professional and financial services industry globally. We empower the world’s premier private capital, investment banking, legal, accounting, and consulting firms with the technology they need to meet rapidly changing client, investor, and regulatory requirements, deliver the right insights to the right professionals, and operate more competitively. Our Intapp Platform is purpose-built to modernize these firms. The platform facilitates greater team collaboration, digitizes complex workflows to optimize deal and engagement execution, and leverages proprietary AI to help nurture relationships and originate new business. By better connecting their most important assets—people, processes, and data—our platform helps firms increase client fees and investment returns, operate more efficiently, and better manage risk and compliance. The professional and financial services industry is one of the largest sectors in the global economy. Firms in this industry operate in a highly connected ecosystem, providing valuable expertise, insight, and advice to a broad range of companies across multiple transactions and engagements. The industry is competitive and uniquely structured around highly experienced partners and professionals who leverage knowledge, intellectual capital, and relationships to succeed, as opposed to providing physical goods. Firms must manage an intricate web of complex, non-linear relationships spread across various functions, processes, and personnel while also navigating an ever-changing regulatory environment. Historically, firms in the professional and financial services industry have either relied on internally built technology solutions and legacy on-premises software or attempted to use horizontal software providers for their industry-specific technology needs. Internally built or legacy solutions tend to be outdated, expensive, and cumbersome to maintain, while horizontal solutions do not align well with how these firms operate and require heavy customization. As a result, we believe these firms are increasingly embracing industry-specific software and AI technology to achieve improved levels of growth, investment, returns, productivity, risk management, and a differentiated experience for their clients, teams, and investors. Our deep understanding of the professional and financial services industry has enabled us to develop a suite of solutions on the Intapp Platform tailored to address these challenges faced by firms. We offer two solutions: DealCloud is our deal and relationship management solution for financial services firms. The solution manages firms’ market relationships, prospective clients and investments, current engagements and deal processes, and operations and compliance activities, allowing investors and advisors to react faster, make better decisions, and execute the best deals. For investment banks and advisory firms, this helps enhance their coverage models, achieve greater win rates, and drive higher success fees. For investors, this helps increase origination volume, support investment selection, and drive greater returns. OnePlace is our solution to manage all aspects of a professional services firm’s client and engagement lifecycle. The solution improves client strategy and targeting, business development and origination, and work delivery, increasing financial performance and regulatory compliance. Professionals make better decisions faster by leveraging more institutional knowledge from across the firm. We believe our solutions provide us with a competitive advantage, driven by our deep domain expertise gained over 20 years of serving professional and financial services firms. We have cultivated difficult-to-replicate, privileged access to these firms to develop thorough expertise in how they work and what they need. Clients value our scalable platform’s differentiated domain expertise, purpose-built capabilities, comprehensive end-to-end offering, data-driven AI insights, and industry brand. Our client base represents many of the world’s premier professional and financial services firms, including 96 of the Am Law 100 law firms, 7 of the Top 8 accounting firms, and over 900 private capital and investment banking firms. We sell our software on a subscription basis through a direct enterprise sales model. As of March 31, 2021, we had over 1,600 clients. Our business has historically grown through a combination of expanding within our existing client base—including additional users and capabilities—and selling to new clients. We have had success in driving customers to further adoption, and currently have more than 20 clients with contracts greater than $1 million of annual recurring revenues (“ARR”). With our scalable, modular cloud-based platform, we believe we are well positioned to continue our growth.

General Information,"IAS is a leading digital advertising verification company by revenue. Our mission is to be the global benchmark for trust and transparency in digital media quality for the world’s leading brands, publishers, and platforms. With our cloud-based technology platform and the actionable insights it provides, we deliver independent measurement and verification of digital advertising across all devices, channels, and formats, including desktop, mobile, connected TV (“CTV”), social, display, and video. Our proprietary and Media Rating Council (the “MRC”) accredited Quality Impressions™ metric is designed to verify that digital ads are served to a real person rather than a bot, viewable on-screen, and appear in a brand-safe and suitable environment in the correct geography. Without an independent evaluation of digital advertising quality, brands and their agencies previously relied on a wide range of publishers and ad platforms to self-report and measure the effectiveness of campaigns without a global benchmark to understand success. We are an independent, trusted partner for buyers and sellers of digital advertising to increase accountability, transparency, and effectiveness in the market. We help advertisers optimize their ad spend and better measure consumer engagement with campaigns across platforms, while enabling publishers to improve their inventory yield and revenue. As a leading ad verification partner, we have deep integrations with all the major advertising and technology platforms including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Instagram, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Pinterest, Snap, Spotify, The Trade Desk, Twitter, Verizon Media, Xandr, and YouTube. Our platform uses advanced artificial intelligence (“AI”) and machine learning (“ML”) technologies to process over 100 billion daily web transactions on average. With this data, we deliver real-time insights and analytics to our global customers through our easy-to-use IAS Reporting Platform helping brands, agencies, publishers, and platform partners improve media quality and campaign performance. Our customers, consisting collectively of advertising customers and publisher customers, currently activate our solutions globally across 111 countries. We serve customers globally with 11 offices in 8 countries. Our efficient go-to-market strategy has fueled our growth and ability to serve 2,062 current customers, including both 1,924 advertising customers and 138 publisher customers, as of March 31, 2021. We serve 35% of the top 150 U.S. advertisers. Our net revenue retention of advertising customers were 132% and 110% as of March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. The digital advertising market is expected to reach $526 billion in global spend by 2024, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 12% from 2020 to 2024, according to eMarketer. We intend to capitalize on this opportunity and several high growth segments including programmatic, contextual, social, and connected TV.

General Information,"Intensity Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical stage biotechnology company passionately committed to applying scientific leadership in the field of localized cancer reduction leading to anti-cancer immune activation. Our new approach involves the direct injection into tumors of a unique product created from our DfuseRx℠ discovery platform. Our lead product candidate, INT230-6, consists of two proven anti-cancer cytotoxic agents, cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate, mixed with the amphiphilic molecule (SHAO) — all in one vial. Cisplatin was first approved in 1978 for testicular cancer. Per the product labeling, cisplatin’s approved indications include treatment of testicular, ovarian and bladder cancer. The drug is also used widely in several other cancers, including pancreatic and bile duct cancer. Vinblastine sulfate was first approved in 1965. Per the product labeling, vinblastine sulfate’s approved indications include treatment of generalized Hodgkin’s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma, advanced carcinoma of the testis, and Kaposi’s sarcoma. The drug is also used in breast and lung cancer. In 2017, we initiated a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study using INT230-6 in the United States under an investigational new drug application (“IND”) authorized by the FDA and in Canada following receipt of a no objection letter from Health Canada. The study, IT-01, is exploring the safety and efficacy of INT230-6 in patients with refractory or metastatic cancers. We completed the Phase 1 dose escalation portion of this study.  We are currently conducting the Phase 2 portion of the trial, which consists of several different expansion cohorts. Four of the cohorts combine our product candidate with Merck’s Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) and 3 arms combine our drug candidate with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s drug Yervoy® (ipilimumab). We are also evaluating INT230-6 in a Phase 2 study (the INVINCIBLE study) in Canada as a treatment before surgery in early stage breast cancer. Between the metastatic study IT-01 and the INVINCIBLE study, we have treated over 115 patients as of Sept. 30, 2021.

We believe our platform is the first to employ both proteomics, or the study of proteins and their functions, and single cell biology in an effort to fully characterize and link cellular function to patient outcomes by revealing treatment response and disease progression. Our single cell proteomics platform, which includes instruments, chip consumables and software, provides an end-to-end solution to reveal a more complete view of protein function at an individual cellular level.  Since our commercial launch in June of 2018, our platform has been adopted by the top 15 global biopharmaceutical companies by revenue and nearly half of the comprehensive cancer centers in the United States to help develop more durable therapeutics, overcome therapeutic resistance, and predict patient responses for advanced immunotherapies, cell therapies, gene therapies, vaccines, and regenerative medicines. Our initial focus has been on developing applications of our platform for cancer immunology and cell and gene therapy. We are now expanding our capabilities to include applications for infectious diseases, inflammatory conditions and neurological diseases. We believe that traditional bulk methods of proteomics analysis, which analyze proteins in bulk samples made up of many different types of cells, lack quality single cell resolution. We designed our platform to reveal functional protein biology and cellular signaling networks at single cell resolution to accelerate the development of advanced medicines.

General Information,"iSpecimen’s mission is to accelerate life science research and development, or R&D, with a global marketplace platform that connects researchers to subjects, specimens and associated data. Our vision is to create an “Amazon-like” global Marketplace of patients, biospecimens and data for research to improve the quality of human life.  iSpecimen is a technology-driven company founded to address a critical challenge: how to connect life science researchers who need human biofluids, tissues and living cells (“biospecimens”) for their research with the billions of biospecimens available (but not easily accessible) in healthcare provider organizations worldwide. Our ground-breaking iSpecimen Marketplace platform was designed to solve this problem and transform the biospecimen procurement process to accelerate medical discovery.  The iSpecimen Marketplace brings new capabilities to a highly fragmented and inefficient biospecimen procurement market. Our technology consolidates the biospecimen buying experience in a single online marketplace that brings together healthcare providers who have biospecimens and researchers across industry, academia and government institutions who need them. We are seeking to transform the world of biospecimen procurement much like the way travel websites changed the consumer buying process for flights, hotels and rental cars.
