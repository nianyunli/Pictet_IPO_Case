General Information,"Day One was founded to address a critical unmet need: children with cancer are being left behind in a cancer drug development revolution. Our name was inspired by the “The Day One Talk” that physicians have with patients and their families about an initial cancer diagnosis and treatment plan. We aim to re-envision cancer drug development and redefine what’s possible for all people living with cancer—regardless of age—starting from Day One. We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing targeted therapies for patients of all ages with genetically defined cancers. Initially, we focus our clinical development efforts on pediatric patients living with cancer, a vulnerable population that has been underserved in the recent revolution in targeted therapeutics and immuno-oncology. Our lead product candidate, DAY101, is an oral, brain-penetrant, highly-selective type II pan-rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma, or pan-RAF, kinase inhibitor. DAY101 has been studied in over 250 patients and has been shown to be well-tolerated as a monotherapy. DAY101 has demonstrated encouraging anti-tumor activity in pediatric and adult populations with specific genetic alterations that result in the over-activation of the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase, or MAPK, pathway leading to uncontrolled cell growth. We have initiated a pivotal Phase 2 (FIREFLY-1) trial of DAY101 for pediatric patients with relapsed or progressive low-grade glioma, or pLGG, the most common brain tumor diagnosed in children, for which there are no approved therapies and no standard of care. We dosed the first patient in this trial in the second quarter of 2021 and we expect to report initial data from this trial in the first half of 2022. DAY101 has been granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of pLGG, based on initial results from a Phase 1 trial which showed evidence of rapid anti-tumor activity, a greater than 50% monotherapy response rate and durable responses in pLGG patients. We also plan to study DAY101 alone or in combination with additional agents that target other key signaling nodes in the MAPK pathway in patient populations where various genetic alterations are believed to play an important role in driving disease.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to discovering and developing transformative treatments for hearing and balance disorders, one of the largest areas of unmet need in medicine. We aim to restore and improve hearing and balance through the restoration and regeneration of functional hair cells and non-sensory support cells within the inner ear. We have built a proprietary platform that integrates single-cell genomics and bioinformatics analyses, precision gene therapy technologies and our expertise in inner ear biology. We are leveraging our platform to advance our pipeline of preclinical gene therapy programs that are designed to selectively replace genes for the treatment of congenital, monogenic hearing loss and to regenerate inner ear hair cells for the treatment of acquired hearing and balance disorders. We are developing our lead gene therapy product candidate, DB-OTO, to provide hearing to individuals born with profound hearing loss due to mutation of the otoferlin, or OTOF, gene. We are also advancing DB-ATO, our gene therapy program designed to restore balance in patients with bilateral vestibulopathy, or BVP, by regenerating lost hair cells within the inner ear. In addition to our gene therapy programs, we are developing DB-020 for the prevention of cisplatin-induced hearing loss, which we are currently evaluating in patients in a Phase 1b clinical trial. We are focused on both hearing loss and balance disorders due to their widespread impact and shared biology. Hearing loss is one of the largest areas of unmet need in medicine and affects approximately 466 million people worldwide, including 48 million people in the United States. Hearing loss can significantly impact mental health, cognition and language development. Beyond hearing loss, dysfunction of the inner ear can lead to severe impairments in balance. Approximately eight million people in the United States report chronic balance problems, which can lead to significant life impairment and an increased risk of falls, potentially resulting in hospitalization, limited mobility and depression. Despite these impacts, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of hearing loss or balance disorders. Decibel Therapeutics reported a net loss of $26.5 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2020, the prospectus says. For the full year ended Dec. 31, 2019, the company reported a net loss of $42.7 million, according to the prospectus.

Our mission is to make the complex healthcare ecosystem easier to analyze, navigate and sell into by providing a comprehensive, cloud-based healthcare commercial intelligence platform. Definitive Healthcare is a leading provider of healthcare commercial intelligence. Our solutions provide accurate and comprehensive information on healthcare providers and their activities to help our customers optimize everything from product development to go-to-market planning and sales and marketing execution. Delivered through our software as a service (“SaaS”) platform, our intelligence has become critical to the commercial success of our over 2,600 customers as of June 30, 2021. Commercial success within the healthcare ecosystem is difficult to achieve. The complex relationships between physicians, hospitals, providers, healthcare insurance companies, government regulators and patients make it particularly difficult to develop products for and sell products into the healthcare ecosystem. To succeed in the industry, companies benefit from deep healthcare commercial intelligence that maps all the major players in the healthcare ecosystem, knowledge of the affiliations and relationships between the industry participants and an ability to size patient populations by disease area, geography and health system. Companies that compete within or sell into this ecosystem can utilize the Definitive Healthcare platform to navigate these complexities, enhance go-to-market strategies and access the provider and decision maker information needed to succeed. Our customers include biopharmaceutical and medical device (“Life Sciences”) companies, Healthcare Information Technology (“HCIT”) companies, healthcare providers and other diversified companies, such as staffing firms, commercial real estate firms, financial institutions and other organizations seeking commercial success in the attractive but complex healthcare ecosystem.

Under the amended terms, the company’s stock will trade under the proposed symbol “DRMA” and its warrants will trade under the proposed symbol “DRMAW” – both on the NASDAQ.) We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focusing on the treatment of medical and aesthetic skin conditions. Our lead product candidate, DMT310, is the first product candidate being developed from our Spongilla technology platform. DMT310 is of a once-weekly topical product derived from a naturally sourced freshwater sponge with multiple components. Based on DMT310’s multiple mechanisms of action, it is currently under clinical development for the treatment of acne vulgaris (or acne), psoriasis vulgaris (or psoriasis), and papulopustular rosacea (or rosacea). Our Spongilla technology platform is based on the use of a naturally growing freshwater sponge, Spongilla lacustris, or Spongilla. We have signed an exclusive supply agreement with one of the larger known harvesters of Spongilla raw material in Russia’s Volga River area for utilization in DMT310. The Spongilla technology used in our product candidates, such as DMT310 and DMT410, comes from the unique chemical and mechanical components produced by Spongilla for its natural defense mechanisms. These specialized mechanisms consist of unique, naturally occurring microscopic siliceous spicules that are uniquely sized to penetrate a patient’s skin, creating microchannels which allow for the naturally occurring chemical components of the Spongilla, or other macromolecules such as botulinum toxin, to penetrate into the dermis for a clinical result. We believe these unique properties may also only require DMT310 to be applied once weekly, which, if approved for acne, would make DMT310 the first once weekly topical prescription product on the market.

We acquire, own and manage mineral and royalty interests in the Permian Basin with the objective of generating cash flow from operations that can be distributed to shareholders as dividends and reinvested to expand our base of cash flow generating assets. Our assets are exclusively focused in the Permian Basin. We benefit from cash flow growth through continued development of our mineral and royalty interests, free of capital costs and lease operating expenses. As of June 30, 2021, we owned mineral and royalty interests representing 75,602 net royalty acres (“NRAs”) when adjusted to a 1/8th royalty.

General Information,"We are a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company pioneering novel small-molecule therapeutic candidates, called gene targeted chimeras (GeneTACs), that are designed to be disease-modifying and target the underlying cause of inherited nucleotide repeat expansion diseases. Certain nucleotide repeat expansion diseases, such as Friedreich ataxia (FA), can result in reduced expression of specific mRNAs; in other diseases, such as myotonic dystrophy type-1 (DM1), Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD), and Huntington disease, the nucleotide repeat expansions result in the generation of toxic gene products, often associated with pathological nuclear foci. Our GeneTACs are designed to selectively bind to genetic repeat sequences, modulate gene expression either by restoring or blocking transcription, and restore cellular health. As a platform, we believe that GeneTACs have broad potential applicability across monogenic nucleotide repeat expansion diseases. We plan to initiate clinical trials with our lead product candidate in Friedreich ataxia (FA) patients to evaluate its safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and effect on FXN levels by the first half of 2022, subject to receiving regulatory clearance to proceed into clinical trials. Note: Friedreich ataxia is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene labeled FXN, which carries the genetic code for a protein called frataxin. In this rare inherited disease, the nerve fibers in the spinal cord and peripheral nerves degenerate, according to a fact sheet published by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) – National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The disease, which does not impair cognitive ability, affects about 1 in every 50,000 people, male and female. FA can lead to loss of mobility, requiring the patient to use a wheelchair. FA also causes heart disease, the leading cause of death in people with this disease.

General Information,"(Note: The company will change its name to DICE Therapeutics, Inc., from DiCE Molecules Holdings, LLC, before the effectiveness of the registration statement, the prospectus says.) We are a biopharmaceutical company leveraging our proprietary technology platform, which we refer to as DELSCAPE, to build a pipeline of novel oral therapeutic candidates to treat chronic diseases in immunology and other therapeutic areas. We are initially focused on developing a pipeline of wholly owned oral small molecule therapeutics against well-validated biologic targets in immunology, with the goal of achieving comparable potency to their systemic biologic counterparts, which have demonstrated the greatest therapeutic benefit to date in these disease areas. Our DELSCAPE platform is designed to discover selective oral small molecules with the potential to modulate protein-protein interactions (PPIs) as effectively as systemic biologics. We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for convenient oral therapies in chronic immunological diseases that offer the therapeutic benefits of systemic biologics. In collaboration with Sanofi, we are also developing a therapeutic candidate for immuno-oncology indications. Our lead therapeutic candidate, S011806, is an oral antagonist of the pro-inflammatory signaling molecule, interleukin-17 (IL-17), which is a validated drug target implicated in a variety of immunology indications. There are two approved antibody therapeutics: COSENTYX (secukinumab), marketed by Novartis, and TALTZ (ixekizumab), marketed by Eli Lilly, but no oral therapies targeting this pathway. COSENTYX and TALTZ are both approved fto treat psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, and collectively generated approximately $5.8 billion in worldwide sales in 2020. We filed a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom for S011806 in July 2021 and plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients. We also are developing oral therapeutic candidates targeting a4ß7 integrin and aVß1/aVß6 integrin to treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), respectively.

General Information,"We are a leading software platform for digital media measurement and analytics. Our mission is to increase the effectiveness and transparency of the digital advertising ecosystem. Through our software platform and the metrics it provides, we help preserve the fair value exchange in the digital advertising marketplace. The advertising industry continues to shift from traditional mediums to an expanding array of digital channels and platforms. Digital advertisers have historically relied on inconsistent, self-reported data from a large number of publishers, social channels and programmatic platforms, making it difficult to form an accurate, unbiased view of how and where their ad budgets are spent. As objectionable content and ad fraud have proliferated across the Internet and other digital channels, advertisers are utilizing independent, third-party solutions to protect their brand equity and optimize the performance of their digital media investments. Our technology addresses this need by providing unbiased data analytics that enable advertisers to increase the effectiveness, quality and return on their digital advertising investments. Our proprietary DV Authentic Ad metric is our definitive metric of digital media quality which measures whether a digital ad is displayed in a fraud-free, brand-safe environment and is fully viewable in the intended geography. Our software platform delivers this metric to our customers in real time, allowing them to access critical performance data on their digital ads. Customers then leverage our data analytics to improve the efficiency of their digital advertising investments by avoiding wasted media spend on blocked or fraudulent ads and to optimize their media strategies in real time by verifying their highest performing ads and content.

We have delighted millions of consumers with authentic, high-quality, approachable wines for over four decades. Founded by our namesake Dan and Margaret Duckhorn in 1976, we began by pioneering Merlot wines in Napa Valley and now champion a curated and comprehensive portfolio of highly acclaimed luxury wines across multiple winery brands, varietals, appellations and price points. Our portfolio is focused exclusively on the desirable luxury segment, the fastest-growing segment of the wine market in the United States, according to IRI data as of Dec. 27, 2020, which we define as wines sold for $15 or higher per 750ml bottle. We sell our wines in all 50 states and over 50 countries at suggested retail prices (“SRPs”) ranging from $20 to $200 per bottle under a world-class luxury portfolio of brands, including Duckhorn Vineyards, Decoy, Kosta Browne, Goldeneye, Paraduxx, Calera, Migration, Canvasback, Greenwing and Postmark.

When I joined The Duckhorn Portfolio just a few days after graduating from college in 1988, it was a thrilling time to become a part of the American wine industry.

With over 500 million downloads, our flagship app has organically become the world’s most popular way to learn languages and the top-grossing app in the Education category on both Google Play and the Apple App Store.

General Information,"(Note: Dutch Bros filed confidentially for an IPO on June 11, 2021. The company filed its S-1 on Aug. 20, 2021. Revenue and net income figures are for the 12 months that ended June 30, 2021. Our sponsor is TSG Consumer Partners, LP, a leading private equity firm.) As of June 30, 2021, we had 471 coffee shops across 11 states, 207 of which were company-operated and 264 of which were operated by our franchise partners. Based on our internal analysis and third-party research conducted by Quantitative Analysis, we believe there is long-term potential for at least 4,000 Dutch Bros locations in the United States. From the prospectus – Founder’s letter signed by Travis Boersma, co-founder and executive chairman: Coffee is what we do, but it is not who we are. My brother Dane and I founded Dutch Bros in 1992. We are third-generation dairy farmers, and changes to that industry were making our prospects pretty grim. So we used that reality as motivation to branch out and try something new. Dane and I shared a desire to do something extraordinary together. We bought a double-head espresso machine, cranked up the stereo, threw open the barn doors and started experimenting with coffee beans.  Pretty soon we were selling espresso from a pushcart in downtown Grants Pass, Oregon. That pushcart cost us everything we had at the time. But we got to be ourselves, rock music, make great coffee and hang out with people. It was a dream come true. Quickly we were making over $100 a day, but we were disciplined and took out just enough for our basic needs. We put the money back into the business and let it snowball.  One pushcart became five. We started to appreciate the social power of the musical element and the freedom to do business our own way. In 1994, we bought our first drive-thru. We didn’t know it at the time, but that was our niche and destiny. We had a patio, so people who wanted to hang out and listen to music could, and then we had our drive-thru, which was more convenient for people in a hurry. Around that time, one of our daily customers wanted to take what we were doing to a neighboring town and offered to pay us monthly for the use of the Dutch Bros name. We thought it sounded cool, so we wrote up an agreement and started training him. He opened a location and started performing just as well as we were with our primary spots.  The most important thing for us was building customer loyalty. If we could figure that out, we were winning. So when people would come back day after day, we rolled out the red carpet. Our broistas would have fun trying to make everyone smile and create a magnetic, contagious experience. That lives on in our company. It’s our culture, what we look for in our employees and our differentiator. We had to learn how to scale the business while maintaining the level of customer experience and loyalty we knew was at the heart of what we do. We turned to franchise partners who were close to the mission and understood what Dutch Bros offers to its customers and communities. From the beginning, they helped us learn, grow, serve our customers and develop our broistas into amazing leaders. In 2008, I made a decision to stop selling franchises to anyone outside the existing Dutch Bros system and decided to grow from within using the leaders our franchise partners helped create. That shift was a game changer for us. In our 30th year in operation, Dutch Bros has expanded from that one pushcart to more than 470 drive-thru coffee locations in 11 states with over 16,500 people employed by us and our franchise partners.  (Note: Dutch Bros priced its IPO on Sept. 14, 2021, at $23 – $3 above the top of its $18-to-$20 range – on 21.05 million shares – to raise $484.15 million.)",Retail - Eating & Drinking Places - Coffee,16500,1992,Contact Information,"110 SW 4th Street Grants Pass, Oregon 97526",(541) 955-4700,http://www.dutchbros.com/,Dutch Bros Inc.,Financial Information,$3137.09mil,$399.56 mil (last 12 months),$6.29 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,BROS,NYSE,21.1,$23.00 - $23.00,$484.2 mil,BofA Securities/J.P.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage company focused on developing and commercializing novel therapies to transform the lives of patients with rare diseases who have limited or no treatment options. We are initially focused on developing treatments for neuromuscular diseases, beginning with myotubular and centronuclear myopathies, or CNM, a group of devastating rare genetic disorders characterized by severe muscle weakness, or myopathy, with shortened life expectancy and significant morbidity. Our lead product candidate, DYN101, is an antisense oligonucleotide, or ASO, designed to be a disease-modifying medicine for treatment of the majority of CNM patients across multiple mutations in both adult and pediatric populations. ASOs are single-stranded, chemically synthesized nucleic acid analogs designed to bind a corresponding strand of ribonucleic acid and alter protein expression. We are conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial in Europe of DYN101, which is called UNITE-CNM, and we intend to expand this trial to sites in the United States in the second half of 2021. We expect to report interim pharmacokinetic, or PK, and safety data from this trial in the second half of 2022 and expect to report final data in 2023. DYN101 has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and rare pediatric disease designation by the FDA. In addition, we are currently preparing to conduct a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of DYN101 called DyNaMic in a pediatric population in Europe, which may be expanded to the United States. Following interim data from the UNITE-CNM Phase 1/2 trial in adults, and subject to regulatory authorization, we expect to commence this pediatric clinical trial in the second half of 2022 in Europe.  Our second program, DYN201, is a discovery-stage program focused on developing a treatment for a group of rare inherited neurodegenerative disorders characterized by spasticity and motor dysfunction called hereditary spastic paraplegias, or HSP. *Note: Net loss figures is in U.S. dollars, converted from euros in the prospectus, for the 12 months that ended March 31, 2021.
