General Information,"Zevia – its name rhymes with stevia, the natural sweetener and sugar substitute – is a high-growth beverage company that is disrupting the liquid refreshment beverage industry through delicious and refreshing zero calorie, zero sugar, naturally sweetened beverages that are all Non-GMO Project Verified. (The Stevia rebaudiana plant is native to Brazil and Paraguay.) We are a pioneering beverage brand, offering a platform of six product lines – Soda, Energy Drinks, Organic Tea, Mixers, Kidz drinks, and Sparkling Water – and 37 flavors. All of our beverages are made with only a handful of plant-based ingredients that most consumers can easily pronounce. Our products are distributed across the U.S. and Canada through a diverse network of major retailers in the food, drug, mass, natural and ecommerce channels. We believe that consumers increasingly select beverage products based on taste, ingredients and fit with today’s consumer preferences, which has benefited the Zevia brand and resulted in over 1 billion cans of Zevia sold to date. We actively seek to minimize our environmental impact and continuously re-evaluate our packaging formats and processes to limit environmental waste. We have never sold a single plastic bottle, which we estimate has eliminated 15,000 metric tons of plastic bottles from the supply chain by selling only aluminum packaging since 2011. In addition, one of our main ingredients, stevia, requires less agricultural water than sugar, furthering our sustainability mission.

General Information,"(IPOScoop has “NO CALL” on this offering because it is NOT a traditional IPO. This is a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange. This offering does not have underwriters. Instead, the investment banks named here are acting as financial advisors.) *Note: The NYSE set a reference price of $18.00 for the ZipRecruiter direct listing, according to an NYSE announcement after the market’s close on Tuesday, May 25, 2021. ZipRecruiter’s common stock is expected to start trading on the NYSE on Wednesday, May 26, 2021. The reference price is NOT the offering price. Our Mission: To actively connect people to their next great opportunity. The Problem: Twenty years after moving online, the job market remains painfully inefficient. Job seekers are required to navigate on their own in order to find the right jobs to apply to, usually across multiple sites, and without effective tools for monitoring new opportunities. Employers in turn are overwhelmed by the complexity of modern recruiting given the abundance of job boards, search engines, and social networks to source talent from. Neither side is an expert at their role. Neither side enjoys the process. Our Business: We founded ZipRecruiter to simplify the job market for both job seekers and employers. Unlike traditional online job sites, ZipRecruiter works like a matchmaker curating job opportunities for job seekers, and candidates for employers. Since the founding of our company in 2010, over 2.8 million businesses and 110 million job seekers have come to ZipRecruiter for their hiring and job search needs. For job seekers across all industries and levels of seniority, we operate like a dedicated recruiter. That means presenting strong fit job opportunities, proactively pitching potential candidates to employers, and providing job seekers with updates on the status of their applications. This makes job seekers feel supported while searching for work. That’s why ZipRecruiter has been the No. 1-rated job seeker app on iOS and Android for the past four years. For employers, we focus on building technology to rapidly deliver quality candidates to companies of all sizes and across all industries.
