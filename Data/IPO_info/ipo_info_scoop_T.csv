General Information,"We are a late-clinical stage, cell therapy company developing an innovative method of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) that we believe has the potential to transform the standard of care in solid organ transplantation, certain severe autoimmune diseases and certain severe non-malignant blood, immune and metabolic disorders. In the organ transplant setting, which is our initial focus, we believe our proprietary therapeutic approach, which we call Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, could prevent organ rejection without the morbidity and mortality associated with the use of lifelong anti-rejection medicines, also known as chronic immunosuppression. Beyond the organ transplant setting, our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy also has the potential to treat a range of severe autoimmune diseases and severe non-malignant blood, immune and metabolic disorders, in each case with potential for similar outcomes to what has previously been observed with HSCT, while mitigating the toxicities, morbidities and extended hospital stay associated with the conditioning regimen typically required by HSCT. We believe that our target indications, individually and collectively, represent a significant unmet need and commercial opportunity. Our lead product candidate, FCR001, which is central to our Facilitated Allo-HSCT Therapy, is a novel allogeneic cell therapy comprised of stem and immune cells that are procured from a healthy donor, who is also the organ donor in the case of organ transplantation. FCR001 is rapidly processed in our GMP facility using our proprietary manufacturing methods. Then, at the time of the transplant, FCR001 is administered to the recipient following nonmyeloablative conditioning, which is designed to be less toxic than myeloablative conditioning. We are currently enrolling patients in FREEDOM-1, a randomized, controlled, open-label Phase 3 registration trial in the United States of FCR001 in 120 adult living donor kidney transplant (LDKT) recipients. The goal of this trial is to evaluate the potential of FCR001, when administered the day after the kidney transplant, to induce durable, drug-free immune tolerance in the recipient of the transplanted kidney. Inducing durable immune tolerance to a transplanted organ without the morbidities associated with lifelong immunosuppression is a goal that has been broadly referred to in the transplant field as the “Holy Grail” of solid organ transplant. The primary endpoint of FREEDOM-1 is to evaluate the proportion of FCR001 treated recipients who are free from immunosuppression without biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) at 24 months post-transplant. The secondary endpoint is to evaluate the change in renal function as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), which estimates how much blood passes through the filters in the kidney that remove waste from the blood, from post-transplant baseline (month one) to month 24 in FCR001 recipients.

General Information,"Talis aims to transform diagnostic testing by developing and commercializing innovative products that are designed to enable accurate, reliable, low cost and rapid molecular testing for infectious diseases and other conditions at the point-of-care. While timely diagnosis of infectious diseases is critically important to enable effective treatment, testing is primarily performed in centralized laboratories, which require samples to be shipped for processing, delaying the return of results by days. Point-of-care testing solves this problem by delivering the timely information necessary for clinical care. We are developing the Talis One platform, a sample-to-answer, cloud-enabled molecular diagnostic platform that, once authorized, could be rapidly deployed to distributed diagnostic settings in the United States and around the world to diagnose infectious disease at the point-of-care. The Talis One platform comprises a compact instrument, single-use test cartridges and software, including a central cloud database, which work together and are designed to provide central laboratory levels of accuracy and be operated by an untrained user. We are developing Talis One tests for respiratory infections, infections related to women’s health and sexually transmitted infections. In January 2021, we submitted a request for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for our Talis One platform with COVID-19 molecular diagnostic assay for the automated detection of nucleic acid from the SARS-CoV-2 virus in nasal swab samples from individuals suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider. Our regulatory strategy is to initially submit for the equivalent of a CLIA-moderate authorization to be followed shortly thereafter with a subsequent filing for the equivalent of a CLIA-waived authorization for use in non-laboratory settings. We are also developing influenza A and influenza B tests to be included as part of a respiratory panel with our COVID-19 test (COVID-Flu Panel). In addition, we plan to initiate a clinical trial to support clearance of a pre-market notification under Section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) of our Talis One instrument with a test for chlamydia and gonorrhea in the second half of 2021 and submit a 510(k) pre-market notification in the first half of 2022. To support our anticipated commercial launch of our COVID-19 test, we have invested in automated cartridge manufacturing lines capable of producing one million cartridges per month, which are scheduled to begin to come on-line in the first quarter of 2021 and we expect will scale to full capacity through 2021. We estimate that the potential annualized market opportunity for COVID-19 point-of-care diagnostic tests in the United States exceeds $7.0 billion. We estimate that the potential annualized market opportunity in the United States for our COVID-Flu Panel and for women’s health diagnostics and sexually transmitted infection diagnostics in our development pipeline was approximately $5.5 billion in 2020.

General Information,"We are a late clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutic candidates to address large market opportunities initially in ophthalmic conditions where there are limited treatment alternatives. Our lead product candidate, TP-03, is a novel therapeutic in Phase 2b/3 that is being developed for the treatment of blepharitis caused by the infestation of Demodex mites, which is referred to as Demodex blepharitis. Blepharitis (“Blephar” is a reference to eyelid and “itis” is a reference to inflammation) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the eyelid margin, redness and ocular irritation, including a specific type of eyelash dandruff called collarettes in Demodex blepharitis. The healthy interaction of the eyelid and the surface of the eyeball is crucial to ocular health. Poorly controlled and progressive blepharitis can lead to worsening of corneal damage over time and, in extreme cases, blindness. According to published studies, there are an estimated 20 million patients in the United States who suffer from blepharitis, with approximately 45%, or approximately nine million, of cases caused by Demodex infestation. To date, we have completed four Phase 2 trials for TP-03 in Demodex blepharitis, all of which met their primary, secondary and/or exploratory endpoints, as applicable, and during which TP-03 was well tolerated. We have commenced our Phase 2b/3 trial, Saturn-1, in September 2020, and intend to commence our Phase 3 trial, Saturn-2, in 2021, both with primary and secondary endpoints consistent with those of our Europa and Io Phase 2 trials. If successful, we expect these trials to support the submission of a new drug application, or NDA, to the Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for TP-03 for the treatment of Demodex blepharitis. Furthermore, we intend to pursue marketing authorizations in jurisdictions outside the United States, including Europe and Japan.

General Information,"TCB, based in Scotland, is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel immunotherapy products that are based on its proprietary allogeneic gamma delta T (abbreviated as GD-T) cell platform. Harnessing the innate ability of GD-Ts has enabled TCB to develop a range of clinical-stage cell therapies designed to combat identified cancers and viral infections. TCB is embarking on Phase II-into-pivotal (Phase III) clinical studies, which are expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2021, following United Kingdom and European Union regulations, with a view to launching its first oncology product, which will be for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (abbreviated as AML). The Company plans to conduct similar clinical trials in the United States in 2022 for the treatment of AML following an application to the FDA in H1 2022. Clinical results generated thus far have enabled TCB to obtain FDA orphan drug status for its method of treatment of AML. In addition to unmodified allogenic GD-Ts for treatment of blood cancers, TCB is also developing an innovative range of genetically modified chimeric antigen receptor modified T cell (abbreviated as CAR-T) products for treatment of solid cancers. TCB believes that solid cancers are more difficult to treat than blood cancers and may require addition of a chimeric antigen receptor (abbreviated as CAR) to (i) help therapeutic cells ‘navigate’ into diseased cancerous tissue, and (ii) retain therapeutic cells in-situ at the lesion for maximum efficacy. In response to the recent pandemic, because GD-Ts are natural killers of virally infected cells, as well as cancerous cells, TCB is planning clinical studies to treat patients with both acute and long term COVID-19 symptoms. We believe acute COVID-19 trials will start in the fourth quarter of 2021.

General Information,"Note: Teads is an ad-tech platform and a spin-off from Altice. Its customers include the BBC, Bloomberg, ESPN, The Washington Post and other publishers. We operate a leading cloud-based end-to-end technology platform that enables programmatic digital advertising for a global curated ecosystem of quality advertisers, their agencies and quality publishers. We operate in the Internet ecosystem (the “Open Web”) outside of advertising platforms, like Facebook and Google, which are known as the walled gardens (the “Walled Gardens”). As an end-to-end solution, our platform consists of buy-side, sell-side, creative, data and AI optimization modules. As a result, we have built deep partnerships with both the demand and supply sides of digital advertising. For advertisers and their agencies, our platform offers a single access point to buy the inventory of many of the world’s best publishers. Through exclusive partnerships with these premium publishers, we enable customers to reach 1.9 billion unique monthly users (as of April 2021), while improving the efficiency, quality and cost of digital ad transactions. For about 3,100 publishers, we are a trusted monetization partner, providing the technology required to monetize their most valuable ad inventory programmatically. By connecting both sides through our integrated platform, known as the Teads Global Media Platform, we solve the digital programmatic advertising industry’s most significant problems related to value chain fragmentation, inefficient digital advertising pricing and quality and scale of inventory. We refer to the ecosystem enabled by Teads Global Media Platform as the curated internet (the “Curated Internet”). Our innovative and comprehensive set of products have been trusted by publishers on the Open Web for almost a decade. In 2012, we pioneered an industry-defining video advertising format known as outstream, which is embedded in-article, specifically in between two paragraphs of editorial text. This invention immediately solved one of the biggest problems in digital advertising related to the lack of quality video inventory. Our platform is also capable of delivering display ads, which are the preferred advertising format for performance-oriented campaigns, as well as other web and app formats.

For example, population and urbanization trends alone demonstrate the enormous demand that will drive growth for innovators in the food and agriculture sector.

General Information,"We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on improving the lives of cancer patients through the discovery, development and commercialization of transformative targeted therapies. Our development programs are designed to address drug resistance mutations in key driver oncogenes, which are mutated genes that cause cancer. Resistance mutations limit the efficacy of existing targeted therapies by rendering tumor cells unresponsive to drugs, and therefore present a critical challenge in cancer treatment today. Our initial focus is on developing the next generation of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs, and is rooted in the critical role that tyrosine kinases play in the development of cancer. Despite the commercial success of approved TKIs, the development of drug resistance is a persistent limitation, narrowing the number of effective treatment options available to patients as they progress through subsequent lines of therapy. Our goal is to develop “pan-variant” kinase inhibitors—inhibitors that target all major cancer causing and drug resistance mutations in clinically significant protein kinases. Our lead product candidate, THE-630, is a pan-variant inhibitor of all major classes of activating and resistance mutations of the KIT kinase, or a pan-KIT inhibitor, for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors, or GIST, a type of cancer characterized by oncogenic activation of KIT. THE-630 is derived from intellectual property exclusively licensed to us by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or ARIAD. We have recently submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the evaluation of THE-630 in patients with advanced GIST whose disease has developed resistance to prior KIT-targeting therapies, and, if cleared by the FDA, we plan to initiate a phase 1/2 dose escalation and expansion clinical trial between late fourth quarter 2021 and mid-first quarter 2022. Our second program is focused on next-generation inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor, or EGFR, that are active against C797S, the most common EGFR mutation that causes resistance to first- or later-line osimertinib treatment in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC.

(See “Business—Competition.”) With companies facing ongoing digital disruption, many lack the capabilities and talent necessary to keep pace with the accelerating rate of technological change. Thoughtworks is a digital native service provider that has been a thought leader at the forefront of technology innovation for the past 28 years. We leverage our vast experience to improve our clients’ ability to respond to change; utilize data assets to unlock new sources of value; create resilient technology platforms that move with business strategies; and rapidly design, deliver and evolve exceptional digital products and experiences at scale.

We believe the innovations in these sectors that have emerged in recent years, partly as a response to the broad social, economic, and behavioral changes arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic, provide attractive opportunities to target high growth companies with technology and business model innovation. For example, by virtue of our team’s industry network and our founder’s recent investments, we have turned our attention towards certain sub-segments in healthcare, including neurology and rare diseases, where we believe we can find attractive targets for our business combination.

In B2C technologies, we will look for ways to capitalize on our team’s previous work with and/or investments; for example, we will leverage our experience in Asian gaming companies and focus on the implications of the big changes that are taking place in the industry due to the surge in the post-COVID consumer demand for a wide range of virtual entertainment and lifestyle products.

Torrid is the largest direct-to-consumer brand of women’s plus-size apparel and intimates in North America by net sales. We grew our net sales by 8% CAGR between 2017 and 2020, making us among the fastest growing direct-to-consumer brands in the plus-size apparel and intimates market. We served 3.2 million active customers and generated net sales of $974 million in 2020. We design for a 25- to 40-year-old curvy woman, who leads a social and active lifestyle and wants to wear clothes that make her look and feel good. While 58% of our 2020 customers are under 40 years old and our average customer is a size 18, our products and style appeal to women of all ages and across the range of plus-sizes. Our target market is large, growing and underserved across both online and in-store channels. The average plus-size woman has historically struggled to find stylish products that fit well and 78% of plus-size women reported that they would spend more on clothing if they had more options available in their size. We believe Torrid stands to benefit from thriving cultural movements involving female empowerment, body positivity and socially-influenced purchasing. Growing celebration of femininity, inclusivity and self-identity, along with the emergence of plus-size celebrities and influencers, inspires young curvy customers to demand more flattering and stylish clothing they are proud to wear. At the same time, younger generations are embracing social media platforms, including Instagram, which act as vehicles for community building and discovery. This seamless, constant exchange of community-based inspiration encourages consumers to purchase better-fitting and youthful clothing that allows for unapologetic self-expression. We believe these cultural shifts will continue to support the growth of the women’s plus-size apparel market. We market directly to consumers via our e-Commerce platform and our physical footprint of 608 stores as of May 1, 2021. E-Commerce sales represented 42% and 48% of net sales in 2018 and 2019, respectively, having grown by 28% in 2018 and 28% in 2019.

We offer our customer high quality products across a broad assortment that includes tops, denim, dresses, intimates, activewear, footwear and accessories.

Our Traeger grills are versatile and easy to use, empowering cooks of all skillsets to create delicious meals with a wood-fired flavor that cannot be replicated with gas, charcoal or electric grills. At the heart of our brand is a passionate and engaged community called the Traegerhood, which includes everyone from casual grillers to competition pitmasters and professional chefs. Our flagship wood pellet grills are internet of things, or IoT, devices that allow owners to program, monitor, and control their grill through our Traeger app, which is used on more than 1.6 million mobile devices per month. We complement our innovative cooking technologies with a digital library of approximately 1,600 original recipes and Traeger Kitchen Live cooking classes, which receive over 144,000 weekly views. In addition, we offer consumable products, such as wood pellets, rubs, and sauces, that drive recurring revenue. Leveraging our authentic brand and the Traegerhood, we have established an omnichannel distribution strategy led by retailers ranging from Ace Hardware and The Home Depot to Wayfair and Williams Sonoma. We complement this retail channel with direct to consumer sales through our website and Traeger app. We believe this accessibility has fueled our growth, as we have increased our revenue from $262.1 million in 2017 to $545.8 million in 2020, representing a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 28%. Today, we estimate that 60% of U.S. households own a grill, representing a total addressable market of approximately 75 million households in the United States.

General Information,"We are a commercial-stage orthopaedic medical device company driving a paradigm shift in the surgical treatment of Hallux Valgus (commonly known as bunions). We have pioneered our proprietary Lapiplasty 3D Bunion Correction System – a combination of novel instruments, implants and surgical methods designed to improve the inconsistent clinical outcomes of traditional approaches to bunion surgery. Although bunions are deformities typically caused by an unstable joint in the middle of the foot that leads to a three-dimensional (3D) misalignment in the foot’s anatomical structure, the majority of traditional surgical approaches focus on correcting the deformity from a two-dimensional (2D) perspective and therefore fail to address the root cause of the disorder. To effectively restore the normal anatomy of bunion patients and improve clinical outcomes, we believe addressing the root cause of the bunion is critical and have developed the Lapiplasty System to correct the deformity across all three anatomic dimensions. Our mission is to be the leader in the surgical treatment of bunions by establishing the Lapiplasty System as the standard of care. A bunion is a painful, disfiguring deformity characterized by a deviated position of the great toe, and easily identified visually by the “bump” at its base. Bunions affect approximately 65 million Americans, and generally increase in prevalence and severity over time. Nearly 25% of adults between the ages of 18 and 65, and over 35% of people over the age of 65, have bunions. Approximately 4.4 million patients in the United States seek medical attention for bunions annually; of these patients, an estimated 1.1 million are deemed surgical candidates, which represents a total annual addressable market opportunity of more than $5 billion.",SURGICAL & MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS & APPARATUS,133,2014,Contact Information,"203 Fort Wade Rd., Suite 150 Ponte Vedra, Florida 32081",(904) 373-5940,http://www.treace.com/,Treace Medical Concepts,Financial Information,$807.36mil,$57.37 mil (last 12 months),$-4.31 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,TMCI,NASDAQ,11.3,$17.00 - $17.00,$191.3 mil,J.P.

General Information,"(Note: The tru Shrimp Companies, Inc., postponed its IPO on Thursday due to adverse market conditions; the small-cap unit IPO had been tentatively scheduled for pricing after the close on Thursday, Feb. 10, 2022, to trade Friday, Feb.11.) We are an early-stage seafood and biopolymer production company pioneering the development and commercialization of a scalable, shallow-water indoor aquaculture technology platform. To date, we have focused nearly exclusively on research and development and now intend to commercialize our technology platform. We expect to become one of the premier domestic producers of premium positioned shrimp and one of the few domestic FDA-registered at-scale producers of chitosan and subsequent chitosan derivatives, which we expect to be produced using Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and to meet or exceed the reference standards set forth in the official chitosan monograph published by the United States Pharmacopeia – National Formulary, or USP-NF. We expect to market USP-grade chitosan and chitosan derivatives to the biomedical, pharmaceutical, dermatology and high-end consumer cosmetic markets. Our extensive research, development and optimization has led to a technology platform that enables us to produce shrimp and shrimp exoskeleton material at scale in a traceable, safe, and documented sustainable manner. The shrimp exoskeleton materials represent a key raw material used in the production of chitosan and chitosan derivatives. We invested approximately $11 million to develop and build Balaton Bay Reef, a pilot production facility commissioned in August 2018. Utilizing our shallow-water indoor aquaculture platform, which we refer to as Tidal Basin Technology, Balaton Bay Reef has produced shrimp and shrimp exoskeleton material confirming the technology, engineering, and processes necessary to commercially scale-up shrimp and shrimp exoskeleton material production in a controlled environment. We expect to construct our first commercial production facility, Madison Bay Harbor, in Madison, South Dakota. Based on management’s estimates and production data from Balaton Bay Reef, we expect it will have the capacity to annually produce up to approximately 1,300,000 pounds of unprocessed head-on/shell-on shrimp, or HOSO shrimp, which we expect will result in approximately 790,000 pounds of processed shrimp and provide shrimp exoskeleton material for up to approximately 2,800 kilograms of chitosan and/or chitosan derivatives. We have entered into an agreement with Parimer Scientific, a contract manufacturing organization, or CMO, to develop private label USP-grade chitosan products from our exoskeleton material and to develop the processes, procedures and equipment necessary for commercial manufacturing of such products. Upon successful completion of this development phase, we intend to enter into a manufacturing agreement with Parimer for commercial production of such products.",Shrimp production,35,2014,Contact Information,"330 Third Street Balaton, MN 56115",(844) 220-7574,http://www.trushrimpcompany.com/,"tru Shrimp Companies, Inc.",Financial Information,$139.7mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$-10.1 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,BTRU,NASDAQ,1.5,$9.00 - $11.00,$15.0 mil,Lake Street Capital Markets/ Maxim Group LLC,-,2/11/2022,Postponed,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers

General Information,"We are a preclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing a robust pipeline of T cell receptor-engineered T cell, or TCR-T, therapies to treat patients with cancer. Our approach is based on the central premise that we can learn from patients who are winning their fight against cancer in order to treat those who are not. Using one of our proprietary platform technologies, TargetScan, we analyze the T cells of cancer patients with exceptional responses to immunotherapy to discover how the immune system naturally recognizes and eliminates tumor cells in these patients. This allows us to precisely identify the targets of T cell receptors, or TCRs, that are driving these exceptional responses. We aim to use these anti-cancer TCRs to treat patients with cancer by genetically engineering their own T cells to recognize and eliminate their cancer. In addition to discovering TCR-T therapies against novel targets, we are using our ReceptorScan technology to further diversify our portfolio of therapeutic TCRs with TCR-T therapies against known targets. We believe this two-pronged approach will enable us to discover and develop a wide array of potential treatment options for patients with cancer. We are advancing a robust pipeline of TCR-T therapy candidates for the treatment of patients with hematologic and solid tumor malignancies. Our lead liquid tumor product candidates, TSC-100 and TSC-101, are in development for the treatment of patients with hematologic malignancies to eliminate residual leukemia and prevent relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HCT. TSC-100 and TSC-101 target HA-1 and HA-2 antigens, respectively, which are well-recognized TCR targets that were identified in patients with exceptional responses to HCT-associated immunotherapy. We plan to submit Investigational New Drug, or IND, applications for each of TSC-100 and TSC-101 with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in the fourth quarter of 2021. In addition, we are developing multiple TCR-T therapy candidates for the treatment of various solid tumors. One of the key goals for our solid tumor program is to develop what we refer to as multiplexed TCR-T therapy. We are designing these multiplexed therapies to be a combination of up to three highly active TCRs that are customized for each patient and selected from our bank of therapeutic TCRs, which we refer to as ImmunoBank. We are currently advancing four solid tumor programs, TSC-200, TSC-201, TSC-202, and TSC-203, through lead optimization, and expect to submit IND applications for at least three of our four solid tumor TCR-T therapy candidates in the second half of 2022, with the fourth IND expected to be submitted in 2023.

General Information,"This Cayman Islands-incorporated SPAC is backed by Tuatara Capital, a private equity firm focused on the cannabis industry. From the prospectus: Our sponsor is an affiliate of Tuatara Capital, a cannabis sector-focused private equity firm founded in 2014. Tuatara Capital had over $390 million in investment capital as of July 2020. The firm is led by seasoned professionals with experience as principal investors, investment advisors, and entrepreneurs. Since its founding, Tuatara Capital has built a proprietary database of over 3,500 cannabis companies that have launched or have been seeking capital. In July 2020, Tuatara Capital completed raising its second flagship fund with a focus on long-term investments in growth-stage businesses in the emerging legal cannabis industry. We intend to focus our search for businesses in the cannabis industry that are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which they are located or operate and, in particular, we will not invest in, or consummate a business combination with, a target business that we determine has been operating, or whose business plan is to operate, in violation of U.S. federal laws, including the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. We believe that the normalization of cannabis and its many uses and applications—in social consumption, pharmaceuticals, health and wellness and industrial raw materials and fiber—is creating a rarely seen opportunity to invest in related businesses. At the same time, the cannabis industry is highly fragmented and subject to a complex regulatory framework, creating significant barriers to entry. As the industry continues to transition to a new legal and regulatory landscape, we believe that many companies will need a partner that can assist in providing a level of operational and financial expertise to support their growth.

General Information,"We are a precision oncology company focused on developing purpose-built therapies to overcome tumor resistance and improve outcomes for patients with cancer. The widespread availability of approved targeted oncology treatments, such as kinase inhibitors, has transformed the cancer treatment landscape. Despite the therapeutic benefit that targeted oncology treatments have created for some patients, the response rate and duration of efficacy is often limited by acquired drug resistance and other shortcomings of existing therapies. We are using our proprietary SNÅP platform, which is optimized to enable rapid and precise refinement of structural design through iterative molecular SNÅPshots, in order to generate next-generation product candidates that are specifically designed to address acquired drug resistance and provide alternative treatment options. We are initially focused on developing a pipeline of selective inhibitors of the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor, or FGFR, family, which are altered in approximately 7% of all cancers. Our lead product candidate, TYRA-300, is designed to selectively inhibit FGFR3, with an initial focus on patients with bladder cancer. We anticipate filing an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, for TYRA-300 in mid-2022. In addition, we have pipeline development programs targeting FGFR2-related cancers, FGFR3-related achondroplasia, REarranged during Transfection kinase, or RET, and FGFR4-related cancers.
