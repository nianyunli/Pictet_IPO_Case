General Information,"(Note: This is NOT an IPO. This is a NASDAQ uplisting from the OTCQB market, where the company’s stock trades under the symbol “MRZM”. On Monday, Feb. 14, 2022, Marizyme’s stock traded at about $1.95 per share on the OTCQB tier. The S-1 prospectus was filed Feb.14, 2022. No terms were filed other than the anticipated price range. Some IPO experts, however, have pegged this NASDAQ uplisting’s estimated proceeds at about $15 million to $17 million.) Marizyme is a multi-technology life science company dedicated to the acceleration, development and commercialization of medical technologies that promote patient health and present potential for rapid revenue growth. Currently, we are focused on developing three medical technology platforms – DuraGraft, MATLOC and Krillase – each of which is clinically tested and backed by a portfolio of patented or patent-pending assets. DuraGraft is a single-use intraoperative vascular graft treatment that protects against ischemic injury and reduces the incidence and complications of graft failure, therefore maintaining endothelial function and structure while improving clinical outcomes. MATLOC is a point-of-care, lab-on-chip digital screening and diagnostic device platform, initially being developed for quantitative chronic kidney disease, or CKD, assessment. Our Krillase protein enzyme provides therapeutics for wound healing, thrombosi, and pet health. Our three medical technologies – DuraGraft, MATLOC and Krillase – are expected to serve an immediate and large market need in several areas, including, cardiac surgery, CKD, and pet health. We are currently preparing DuraGraft, our endothelial damage inhibitor, or EDI, and MATLOC 1, our CKD screening and diagnostic device, for the FDA De Novo classification process and 510(k) application, respectively. We filed a pre-submission letter for DuraGraft with the FDA in November 2021 and we expect to submit the DuraGraft De Novo request to the FDA later this year. Once we file with the FDA, we expect to receive approval for the DuraGraft De Novo request later in 2022 and approval for the MATLOC 1 510(k) application sometime in 2023. Upon receiving FDA approvals, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we expect to quickly commercialize these two products and build revenue rapidly utilizing multiple strategic partners and revenue channels. Concurrently, our Krillase development team is planning an animal clinical study, to be conducted in 2022, which we expect will facilitate our entry into the pet health market and generate revenue through the sale of Krillase-based canine dental hygiene products. Following our introduction of Krillase into the pet health market, we plan to file an application with the FDA for the approval of Krillase for human use. With our DuraGraft, MATLOC and Krillase platforms, we have the potential for bringing three FDA-approved products to market. For 2022, our primary business priority is achieving FDA approval of DuraGraft as a medical device for coronary bypass artery graft, or CBAG, procedures, through the De Novo classification request process. Following FDA approval of DuraGraft, which we anticipate but cannot guarantee, we expect to begin to distribute and sell DuraGraft in the United States through the efforts of a strategic partner. If we are not able to find an appropriate strategic partner, we will have to build our own marketing and sales capabilities at a significant cost to us and with no guarantee of success. DuraGraft first received its CE marking in August 2014. CE marking signifies that DuraGraft may be sold in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and DuraGraft has therefore been assessed as meeting EEA safety, health, and environmental protection requirements. We will continue marketing efforts in Europe and in other countries that accept CE marking. In addition, we intend to fully develop and market DuraGraft in the U.S. for fat grafting procedures in plastic surgery procedures. In 2022, we also intend to prioritize the advancement of our MATLOC 1 CKD point-of-care device through the completion of a clinical trial followed by the filing of an FDA 510(k) application, which we expect the FDA to approve by the end of 2023. We will concurrently be advancing our Krillase technology through a planned animal study with the objective of generating revenue in the pet health market. As we achieve FDA approvals, we intend to prioritize the commercialization of our DuraGraft, MATLOC and Krillase platform products through multiple distribution and marketing channels in the U.S. We expect that once we enter the commercialization phase, we will be able to rapidly generate revenue growth.

Our novel prostate cancer genomic testing solutions, SelectMDx and ConfirmMDx, provide physicians with a clear clinical pathway to accurately identify clinically significant prostate cancer while minimizing the use of invasive procedures that are prone to complications. Our unique approach combines advanced clinical modeling with genomic data to provide each patient with a personalized cancer risk profile, which provides more accurate and actionable information than standard risk factors (e.g., Prostate Specific Antigen (“PSA”), digital rectal exam (“DRE”), age) used by clinicians. Our lead products address men at risk for developing prostate cancer, but in addition, we are actively developing testing solutions to help with the management of men diagnosed with prostate cancer, with the goal to provide our clients with a menu of tools spanning the continuum of prostate cancer diagnosis and care. Our expertise in precision diagnostics and our portfolio of novel biomarkers for diagnostic, prognostic and predictive molecular assays supports our active pipeline of new testing solutions for prostate and other urologic diseases. Prostate cancer is presently the most common, and second deadliest, form of cancer in men. Approximately 25 million PSA tests are performed each year, and over 15% of these reveal heightened PSA levels, leading to an estimated pool of over three million undiagnosed men informed each year of their heightened risk for prostate cancer based on elevated PSA test results. Other than repeated invasive needle biopsy procedures, these symptomatic men and their clinicians have limited tools to manage their cancer risk.

General Information,"We are a commercial-stage medical technology company focused on developing, manufacturing, and commercializing minimally invasive solutions to meet the distinct uterine healthcare needs of women. We have established a broad product line of commercially available, minimally invasive alternatives to hysterectomy, which are designed to address the most common causes of abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) in most uterine anatomies. Our solutions can be used in a variety of medical treatment settings and aim to address the drawbacks associated with alternative treatment methods and to preserve the uterus by avoiding unnecessary hysterectomies. There is a significant body of peer-reviewed literature that we believe validates the clinical performance of our solutions and supports the ability of our products to meaningfully improve the quality of life for women suffering from AUB. For example, the short- and long-term safety and effectiveness of our endometrial ablation systems, the Minerva ES and the Genesys HTA, have obtained approval through the premarket approval application (PMA) process, and have been evaluated in multiple clinical trials that had sites audited by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). AUB is caused by a variety of factors and is characterized by menstrual blood loss in excess of 80 milliliters (ml) per menstrual cycle, which is two to three times the average blood loss during a normal menstrual cycle. These factors include structural causes within the uterus, such as fibroids and polyps, and non-structural causes, such as hormonal imbalances. AUB can have a significant impact on a woman’s quality of life. Women suffering from AUB typically need to change their sanitary products every two hours or less and pass blood clots the size of a quarter or larger. When left untreated, AUB can stop women from engaging in ordinary daily activities during menstruation, which interferes with their family, social, personal and professional lives. Prolonged bleeding can result in fatigue and, in extreme cases, anemia. We offer a broad suite of products for the treatment of structural and non-structural causes of AUB in most uterine anatomies. Our devices are utilized by obstetrician-gynecologists (OB/GYNs) across a variety of medical treatment settings, including hospitals, ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) and physician offices.",SURGICAL & MEDICAL INSTRUMENTS & APPARATUS,139,2008,Contact Information,"4255 Burton Dr. Santa Clara, CA 95054",(855) 646-7874,http://www.minervasurgical.com/,"MINERVA SURGICAL, INC.",Financial Information,$457.09mil,$51.78 mil (last 12 months),$-42.74 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,UTRS,NASDAQ,6.3,$12.00 - $12.00,$75.0 mil,J.P.

General Information,"Our mission: Eliminate the organ transplant waiting list. We are a life sciences company pioneering a novel technology for bioengineering fully transplantable human organs to help save and improve patients’ lives. Organ disease is a major public health issue. According to the American Transplant Foundation there are an estimated 114,000 people in the United States waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant, and on average 20 people die daily due to lack of available organs. We have developed a proprietary perfusion technology platform for bioengineering organs that we believe will efficiently scale to address the shortage of available human organs. Our initial development focus is on human livers and kidneys, and we have demonstrated the ability to bioengineer these organs with functional vasculature and important organ function in preclinical studies. In addition, we believe our technology platform will be able to develop other organs, including lungs, pancreas, and hearts. We have collaborations with the Mayo Clinic, Mount Sinai and the Texas Heart Institute, and our strategic investors include DaVita, Baxter and CareDx. Our proprietary perfusion decellularization and recellulariziation technology harnesses the powerful evolutionary forces shaping complex organ development and the regenerative capabilities of living human cells. We believe the organs we are developing could have significant functional and immunological advantages compared to other organ development techniques which rely on the genetic modification of animals cells, such as xenotransplantation.

General Information,"Our business strategy is to identify, combine with and maximize the value of a company that has either recently emerged from bankruptcy court protection or will require incremental capital as part of a balance sheet restructuring. Our focus will be on companies with an enterprise value of approximately $750 million to $2 billion. The economic dislocation caused by Covid-19 has impacted the financial performance of a large number of otherwise quality middle-market companies, many of which are highly levered due to either private equity ownership or the general expansion of corporate borrowing over the most recent economic cycle. These companies will likely either require comprehensive balance sheet restructurings to right-size their respective capital structures or incremental equity capital to support liquidity and business investment. This process is already playing out across the U.S., as evidenced by the number of corporate bankruptcies through July of 2020 – the highest since 2009. Our sponsor was formed by Mudrick Capital, which was founded in 2009 to focus on investment opportunities in distressed credit and post-restructured equities. As of September 18, 2020, Mudrick Capital managed approximately $2.6 billion, primarily for institutional clients such as pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, family offices, funds of funds and high net worth individuals.

General Information,"We intend to concentrate our efforts on identifying businesses that are either directly or indirectly connected with the music sector, with particular emphasis on businesses where our significant strategic and operational expertise and long-standing position within the music industry will be a value-additive proposition to potential target businesses.

General Information,"(This is NOT an IPO. This is an offering of American Depositary Shares (ADS) – an uplisting to the NASDAQ. Four ADS will represent one ordinary share. From the prospectus: “Our ordinary shares are listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, where they trade under the symbol of “MOY” and last closed on Nov. 3, 2021, at a a price equivalent to US$17.48 per ADS.”) We believe we are a leading developer and manufacturer (in terms of production capacity) of advanced laser communication technology for aerospace communications networks in government and commercial markets. Laser communication networks provide connectivity from the sky, allowing for high data rates and secure long-distance data transmission between moving objects for wireless terrestrial, airborne- and space-based applications. Our technology and products are designed to provide the backbone for connectivity to link satellites, high-altitude platforms, unmanned aerial vehicles, aircraft and the ground with secure wireless data transmission. We aim to industrialize laser communication by focusing on standardization and cost-efficiency. We believe that we are one of the first companies to develop laser communication technology at commercially attractive price points for use in both government and commercial markets. By leveraging our strong technical expertise and early mover advantage, we aim to become the go-to supplier for the “internet above the clouds.” We were founded in 2009 by former DLR scientists. We have invested in developing and optimizing our laser communication technology, which we are now commercializing. We have developed pre-serial product versions of our flagship CONDOR inter-satellite link terminal and our HAWK airborne terminal, and are currently ramping up serial production to enable customers to deploy our technology at scale. We believe that we are one of a few companies offering a commercially viable laser communication terminal solution combining light weight, robustness, high data rate and high power efficiency at attractive prices. In 2020, we were awarded two contracts by Telesat and another customer for our CONDOR terminals in connection with two U.S. governmental programs launched by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) and the Space Development Agency (“SDA”), respectively. Most recently, on Oct. 31, 2021, we entered into a strategic agreement with Northrop Grumman International Trading, Inc.
