(Incorporated in the Cayman Islands) Innovation has been a major driving force in the global economy. In areas such as artificial intelligence, autonomous driving and advanced manufacturing, innovative technology and services companies are changing the competitive space of existing industries and creating new industries at a record pace. For example, Level 4 autonomous driving is expected to become a reality in the next few years as a result of innovations such as remote sensing methods like Lidar (light detection and radar) and other AI technologies, and 3D printing technologies are transforming traditional manufacturing from mass production to mass customization. Innovative companies such as Tesla and Luminar have been growing significantly faster than companies in traditional industries, rewarding investors who have recognized the vision and conviction of such companies. Looking ahead, we expect disruptive technology and innovative services businesses to play even bigger roles in driving the global economy. Investors who have the expertise to find and evaluate such opportunities will continue to benefit from the trend.

General Information,"Kidpik offers subscription services for children’s clothing, including shoes, for girls and boys in sizes 2T-16. Kidpik styles and delivers outfits directly to members’ doors. To determine what members will receive in a subscription box, consumers take a 3-minute style quiz on www.kidpik.com, which provides us information about silhouettes, colors, prints, fits, level of sparkle, favorite looks, and other style preferences they or their kids may have. Members then select a box delivery frequency that works best for them – every 4, 6, or 12 weeks, and enter their shipping and payment information. Our stylists, in conjunction with our propriety algorithm, select coordinating, mix-&-match outfits which are personalized to each child’s unique style preferences. Using our own warehouse facility and management team, we ensure that each box is packed consistently. The outfits in the box are picked by our stylists and are a surprise to our members when they receive their box. The box of personalized fashion is shipped based on our members’ chosen frequency. Members pay no styling, shipping, return or exchange fees for their boxes and only pay for what they keep. If a member would like to return or exchange any item, it is free. They are only required to put the items into a pre-paid USPS bag, which we provide upon delivery, and drop it in a USPS mailbox.
