Our engineered viruses are designed to induce immunogenic death through direct viral-mediated cytotoxicity in cancer cells, thus releasing tumor neo-antigens and creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment at the site of injection. Our approach combines an in-depth knowledge of viral immunotherapy with extensive clinical experience across a wide range of indications. Based on the broad range of data that we have generated from our preclinical models and clinical trials using our approach, we have observed what we believe to be systemic immune response against locally injected tumors and their distant metastases. We have established two oncolytic viral immunotherapy platforms based on novel, genetically modified adenovirus and herpes simplex virus (HSV) constructs. In our clinical results to date from CAN-2409, our lead product candidate from our adenovirus platform, and CAN-3110, our lead product candidate from our HSV platform, we have observed that these candidates may have the potential to address significant unmet patient need and improve clinical outcomes in novel indications across broader patient populations. Our most advanced product candidate, CAN-2409, is an off-the-shelf adenovirus product candidate combined with the prodrug valacyclovir that has generated promising clinical activity across a range of solid tumor indications, including our lead indication of prostate cancer. We are currently conducting, as part of our most advanced CAN-2409 program, a Phase 3 clinical trial in the United States under a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, with the FDA for CAN-2409 in combination with the prodrug valacyclovir in patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer who have an intermediate or high-risk for progression. We expect to complete enrollment for this trial in the third quarter of 2021 with a final data readout in 2024. We are also evaluating CAN-2409 in newly diagnosed high-grade glioma. The FDA has granted CAN-2409 Fast Track designation for use in this setting in combination with standard of care surgery and chemoradiation. We intend to initiate a potential registrational Phase 3 trial in this indication in the first half of 2022. In addition, we are advancing development of our HSV platform product candidates for different solid tumor indications. Our lead HSV product candidate, CAN-3110, is currently in an ongoing investigator-initiated Phase 1 clinical trial in our initial target indication of recurrent high-grade glioma, and we expect to report additional biomarker results in the fourth quarter of 2021.

General Information,"We are a medical device company focused on transforming vascular closure for the benefit of patients, hospitals and physicians. Our products address the over 5.6 million catheter-based coronary, peripheral and electrophysiology procedures in the United States that require vascular access site closure each year. We have purposefully built and optimized our VASCADE family of products to address the key clinical and economic challenges of manual compression, the traditional standard of care for vascular closure in these procedures. Designed around an easy to use, catheter-based delivery system and the natural clot-inducing properties of collagen, our VASCADE device is the only marketed vascular closure device clinically proven to both increase workflow efficiency and reduce access site complications relative to manual compression for coronary and peripheral procedures. Similarly, our VASCADE MVP device is the only marketed vascular closure device clinically proven and labeled to improve workflow relative to manual compression for electrophysiology procedures. Importantly, these improvements drive meaningful cost savings for our customers, which consist of hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers and other treatment facilities. We believe our substantial body of clinical evidence supports the compelling value proposition of our products and will drive their continued adoption in the $1.4 billion annual addressable U.S. market for vascular access site closure in coronary, peripheral and electrophysiology procedures. Catheter-based, minimally invasive alternatives to open surgery have transformed cardiovascular medicine. The majority of these procedures gain access to the vascular system through the large femoral artery or vein in the patient’s groin, which creates an access site opening in the vessel that requires closure. In 2019 in the United States, there were approximately 5.2 million catheter-based coronary and peripheral procedures, and 400,000 catheter-based electrophysiology procedures, the latter of which generally require two to five access sites per procedure.",Surgical & Medical Instruments & Apparatus,142,2002,Contact Information,"1615 Wyatt Drive Santa Clara, CA 95054",(408) 470-7170,http://www.cardivamedical.com/,"Cardiva Medical, Inc.",Financial Information,,$40.7 mil (last 12 months),$-13.2 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,TBA,NYSE,0.0,$0.00 - $0.00,$75.0 mil,J.P.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming the lives of patients with devastating diseases by applying our novel CRISPR platform, CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA, or chRDNA, pronounced “chardonnay,” toward the development of next-generation genome-edited cell therapies. Our renowned founders, including a Nobel laureate, are pioneers in CRISPR genome editing. Our chRDNA technology has demonstrated superior specificity and high efficiency in preclinical studies, which enables us to perform multiple precise genomic edits, while maintaining genomic integrity. We believe that our technology has broad potential to generate gene and cell therapies in oncology and in therapeutic areas beyond oncology, including immune cell therapies, cell therapies derived from genome-edited induced pluripotent stem cells, or iPSCs, and in vivo genome-editing therapies. The genome-editing technologies currently used in the allogeneic cell therapy field generally have limited efficiency, specificity and versatility for performing the multiple precise genomic edits necessary to address insufficient persistence. Our chRDNA technology is designed to address these genome-editing limitations and improve cell therapy activity.

General Information,"We are a newly formed commercial real estate finance company – a real estate investment trust (REIT) – dedicated to making loans to leading operators and property owners in the cannabis industry. We are externally managed by Chicago Atlantic REIT Manager, LLC (our “Manager”). We intend to elect to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending Dec. 31, 2021. Our Manager and its affiliates seek to originate real estate loans between $5 million and $200 million, generally with one- to five-year terms, and amortization when terms exceed three years. We generally act as co-lenders in such transactions and intend to hold up to $30 million of the aggregate loan amount, with the remainder to be held by affiliates or third- party co-investors. We believe that cannabis operators’ limited access to traditional bank and non-bank financing has provided attractive opportunities for us to make loans to companies that exhibit strong fundamentals but require more customized financing structures and loan products than regulated financial institutions can provide in the current regulatory environment. We believe that continued state-level legalization of cannabis for medical and adult use creates an increased loan demand by companies operating in the cannabis industry and property owners leasing to cannabis tenants. Note: Revenue and net income figures (in the IPO Profile chart) are for the six-month period from the REIT’s date of inception on March 30, 2021, through Sept. 30, 2021, the prospectus says. John Mazarakis, the executive chairman of our board of directors, co-founded Chicago Atlantic Group in April 2019. He has served as our executive chairman since our inception in March 2021. As a proven entrepreneur and operator with successful ventures in real estate, retail, and hospitality. Mr. Mazarakis brings over 20 years of entrepreneurial, operational, and managerial experience. Anthony Cappell is our CEO and a director. Mr. Cappell co-founded Chicago Atlantic Group in April 2019. He has served as our CEO since our inception. Before founding Chicago Atlantic, Mr. Cappell was a managing director and head of underwriting at Stonegate Capital, a private credit investment firm focused on lower middle-market businesses and emerging brands from July 2016 to October 2018. We do not have any employees. Our loans are sourced and overseen by the members of our Manager’s team, which as of Nov. 22, 2021, consists of 24 investment and other professionals who are employees of our Manager and/or its affiliates and certain of whom are also our officers. As of Nov. 22, 2021, our sponsor, Chicago Atlantic Group, LLC, and its affiliates, through affiliated private funds and co-investors, had originated and closed 30 loans totaling approximately $649.0 million to companies operating in the cannabis industry, had approximately $318.3 million of loans outstanding, and were committed to fund approximately $120.0 million in additional loans under commitments from existing credit facilities (subject to customary closing conditions).

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing our lead clinical candidate, CIN-107, for the treatment of hypertension and other cardio-renal diseases. CIN-107 is a highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitor of aldosterone synthase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of aldosterone in the adrenal gland. CIN-107 has been designed to use a differentiated mechanism of action, direct inhibition of aldosterone synthase production, with the goal of providing an improved treatment for patients suffering from hypertension, or high blood pressure. Despite the widespread availability of multiple antihypertensive agents, there remains a significant unmet medical need as more than half of the 108 million hypertensive patients in the United States do not achieve blood pressure control. We are evaluating the efficacy and safety profile of CIN-107 as a potential treatment for the broader hypertensive population, including different subpopulations of hypertensive patients who have not achieved blood pressure control despite treatment.  We are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as our BrigHtn trial, of CIN-107 in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled despite treatment with three antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic, which is referred to as treatment resistant hypertension, or rHTN, and have recently initiated a separate Phase 2 clinical trial, which we refer to as our HALO trial, in patients with elevated aldosterone levels whose blood pressure is not controlled despite treatment with one antihypertensive agent, which is referred to as uncontrolled hypertension, or uHTN. In addition to hypertension, we are developing CIN-107 for the treatment of primary aldosteronism, or PA, and exploring its utility in ameliorating complications of chronic kidney disease, or CKD. Earlier this year, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial of CIN-107 in patients with confirmed PA, which we refer to as our spark-PA trial, and plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with CKD who have uncontrolled blood pressure in the first half of 2022.

General Information,"We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company using our proprietary Precision Timed Release, or PTR, drug delivery platform technology to build and advance a pipeline of next-generation pharmaceutical products designed to improve the lives of patients suffering from frequently diagnosed conditions characterized by burdensome daily dosing regimens and suboptimal treatment outcomes. We are initially focusing our efforts on the treatment of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, or ADHD. Our PTR platform incorporates a proprietary Erosion Barrier Layer, or EBL, designed to allow for the release of drug substance at specific pre-defined time intervals, unlocking the potential for once-daily multi-dose tablets. We are initially targeting the ADHD stimulant-based treatment market, with an estimated U.S. market size of $15.3 billion in 2020. Stimulants are the most commonly prescribed class of medications for ADHD and account for more than 90% of all ADHD medication prescriptions in the United States. Our two proprietary first-line stimulant medications: CTx-1301 (dexmethylphenidate) and CTx-1302 (dextroamphetamine), are being developed for the treatment of ADHD in the three main patient segments: children (ages 6 -12), adolescents (ages 13-17), and adults (ages18+). Both CTx-1301 and CTx-1302 are designed to address the key shortcomings of currently approved stimulant therapies: to provide an immediate onset of action (within 30 minutes); offer ‘entire active-day’ duration; eliminate the need for a ‘booster/recovery’ dose of short-acting stimulant medications; minimize or eliminate the rebound/crash symptoms associated with early medication ‘wear-off’ and provide favorable tolerability with a controlled descent of drug blood levels. Furthermore, by eliminating the ‘booster’ dose used by up to 60% of ADHD patients in conjunction with their primary medication, we believe our product candidates may provide important societal and economic benefits: reducing the abuse and diversion associated with short-acting stimulant medications; allowing physicians to prescribe one medication versus two; allowing patients to pay for one medication versus two, and allowing payers to reimburse for one medication versus two. We completed a proof-of-concept trial in human subjects to validate our PTR platform and in October 2020, announced positive results from a Phase 1/2 study of CTx-1301 in ADHD patients establishing tolerability, comparative bioavailability and dose proportionality of CTx-1301 versus Focalin® XR. We plan to initiate Phase 3 trials in the fourth quarter of 2021 for CTx-1301 with results expected in late 2022. Assuming we receive positive clinical results from our pivotal Phase 3 trials for CTx-1301, we plan to submit a new drug application, or NDA, for CTx-1301 in the first half of 2023. In addition, we plan to initiate a Phase 1/2 bioavailability study in ADHD patients for CTx-1302 in early 2022 and, if the results from this study are successful, we plan to initiate pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials in all patient segments for CTx-1302 in late 2022 with results expected in early 2024.

Labor shortages are expected to become particularly acute for jobs that are dangerous, tedious or generally less desirable, creating demand for robotic substitutes. The robotics industry is now at the turning point where a new generation of robots is emerging, according to Frost & Sullivan. This new generation of robots is more cost-effective to produce, more maneuverable, capable of dynamic learning and therefore increasingly competent to operate in uncontrolled environments.

General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative, small molecule therapeutics targeting age-related degenerative diseases and disorders of the central nervous system, or CNS, and retina. Currently available therapies for these diseases are limited, with many diseases having no approved therapies or treatments. Our goal is to develop disease modifying treatments for patients with these degenerative disorders by initially leveraging our expertise in the σ-2 (sigma-2) receptor, or S2R, which is expressed by multiple cell types, including neuronal synapses, and acts as a key regulator of cellular damage commonly associated with certain age-related degenerative diseases of the CNS and retina. We believe that targeting the S2R complex represents a mechanism that is functionally distinct from other current approaches in clinical development for the treatment of degenerative diseases. Our lead product candidate, CT1812, is an orally delivered, small molecule antagonist designed to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and bind selectively to the S2R complex. We have initially focused on the development of CT1812 for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease, or AD, a disease that afflicts approximately 6.2 million people in the United States and disease prevalence is expected to more than double by 2050. CT1812 is the first S2R antagonist to reach clinical trials and is currently in Phase 2 development for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Since our inception, we have collaborated and worked closely with key healthcare organizations and thought leading institutions in the field of degenerative diseases to develop and advance our therapeutic candidates.

Collectively, our founders and management team have decades of experience identifying and characterizing the mechanisms that drive cancer initiation and subsequent relapse in women with cancer and have been associated with the development of products such as Kisqali (ribociclib), Arimidex (anastrozole) and Afinitor (everolimus) to treat such cancers. Our development team is advancing a pipeline of innovative therapies with a primary focus on treating female cancers, which include, but are not limited to, breast, ovarian and endometrial cancer. Our first program and lead product candidate, onapristone extended release (“ONA-XR”), builds upon a foundation of successful drug development by our management team and advisors in the field of female hormone-dependent cancers. ONA-XR is a selective and potentially potent antagonist of the progesterone receptor (“PR”), a receptor that is activated by the hormone progesterone and that has been linked to resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapeutics, including anti-estrogen therapies, that are prescribed to treat female hormone-dependent cancers. In 2019, we initiated our Phase 2 trial of ONA-XR in women with ovarian cancer who express high levels of progesterone receptor (“PR+”) and we expect to report preliminary data from this trial in the second half of 2021. In 2020, we initiated a Phase 2 trial of ONA-XR in combination with Arimidex (anastrozole) in PR+ endometrial cancer and a Phase 0 trial of ONA-XR in a window of opportunity study in primary breast cancer, and we expect to report preliminary data in the first half of 2022 and final data in late 2022 for each trial, respectively. The window of opportunity study is a three week study in women with primary breast cancer and subsequent lumpectomy to evaluate the direct effects of ONA-XR on the cancer signaling pathways and the tumor microenvironment.  In 2021, a Phase 1b/2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Ibrance (palbociclib) and Femara (leterozole) in first line metastatic breast cancer patients with biochemically recurrent disease, defined as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive. This is potentially a new clinical opportunity for the estimated 20% of first line (“1L”) patients who are at high risk of early disease progression on Ibrance and Femara therapy. Also in 2021, a Phase 2 investigator-sponsored trial was initiated in collaboration with the Wisconsin Oncology Network to evaluate ONA-XR in combination with Faslodex (fulvestrant) in women with second line (“2L”) or third line (“3L”) metastatic breast cancer. In 2021, we also initiated a sub-study of our Phase 2 trial in 2L/3L metastatic breast cancer, which evaluates the uptake of radiolabeled progesterone (F-FFNP) via PET imaging in breast tumors, with preliminary data expected to come in the first half of 2022. Our second program, CLDN6xCD3 bsAb, is an anti-CD3 x anti-Claudin 6 antigen bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsAbs) that is intended to redirect T-cell-mediated lysis toward malignant cells expressing CLDN6.

Enterprises rely on Couchbase to power the core applications their businesses depend on, for which there is no tolerance for disruption or downtime. Our database is versatile and works in multiple configurations, from cloud to multi- or hybrid-cloud to on-premise environments to the edge, and can be run by the customer or managed by us. We have architected our database on the next-generation flexibility of NoSQL, embodying a “not only SQL” approach. We combine the schema flexibility unavailable with legacy databases with the power and familiarity of the SQL query language, the lingua franca of database programming, into a single, unified platform. Our cloud-native platform provides a powerful modern database that serves the needs of both enterprise architects and application developers. We built Couchbase for the most important, mission-critical applications for the largest enterprises, with the highest performance, reliability, scalability and agility requirements. Any compromise of these requirements could cause these applications to fail—stopping or delaying package delivery for shipping companies, interrupting reservations for travel companies or causing product shortages in stores for retailers. We have spent over a decade building a platform architected to solve our customers’ most difficult database challenges, from scale to flexibility to deployment. This includes enabling Couchbase to not just simply run in the cloud, but to run anywhere from public clouds to hybrid environments and even all the way to the edge, in truly distributed environments with flexibility in and between those environments.

General Information,"We are a commercial-stage medical device company developing, manufacturing and commercializing innovative and minimally invasive neuromodulation solutions for patients with cardiovascular diseases. Our proprietary platform technology, BAROSTIM, leverages the brain’s power to address the imbalance of the Autonomic Nervous System (“ANS”), which causes heart failure (“HF”) and other cardiovascular diseases. Our second-generation product, BAROSTIM NEO, is the first and only commercially available neuromodulation device indicated to improve symptoms for patients with HF with reduced Ejection Fraction (“HFrEF”), or systolic HF. BAROSTIM NEO sends electrical pulses to baroreceptors located in the wall of the carotid artery to signal the brain to modulate cardiovascular function. We estimate that there are about 26 million people globally suffering from HF, including 6.2 million people in the U.S. and 8.6 million people in EU5. HF is characterized by the heart’s inability to effectively circulate blood throughout the body. This causes shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, exercise intolerance, swelling and fluid retention that affects the patient’s quality of life.

General Information,"We are an autonomous vehicle (AV) technology company that is focused on addressing industrial uses for autonomous vehicles. We believe that technological innovation is needed to enable adoption of autonomous industrial vehicles that will address the substantial industry challenges that exist today. These challenges include labor shortages, lagging technological advancements from incumbent vehicle manufacturers, and high upfront investment commitment. Industrial sites are typically rigid environments with consistent standards as opposed to city streets that have more variable environmental and situational conditions and diverse regulations. These differences in operational design domains (ODD) will be major factors that make proliferation of industrial AVs in private settings achievable with less time and resources than AVs on public roadways. Namely, safety and infrastructure challenges are cited as roadblocks that have delayed AVs from operating on public roadways at scale. Our focus on industrial AVs simplifies these challenges because industrial facilities (especially those belonging to a single end customer that operates similarly at different sites) share much more in common than different cities do. Furthermore, our end customers own their infrastructure and can make changes more easily than governments can on public roadways. With these challenges in mind, we are developing an Enterprise Autonomy Suite (EAS) that leverages advanced in-vehicle autonomous driving technology and incorporates leading supporting technologies like data analytics, fleet management, cloud, and connectivity. EAS provides a differentiated solution that we believe will drive pervasive proliferation of industrial autonomy and create value for customers at every stage of their journey towards full automation and the adoption of Industry 4.0. Note: The company has not generated revenue. Cyngn plans to start marketing its EAS to customers in 2022. It plans to earn revenue through subscriptions, including through its RaaS (Robotics as a Service) model. (Note: Cyngn priced its IPO on Oct. 19, 2021, at $7.50 – the low end of its $7.50-to-$9.50 price range – and sold 3.53 million shares, the same number of shares in the prospectus, to raise $26.48 million.)",SERVICES - PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE,33,2013,Contact Information,"1015 O’Brien Dr. Menlo Park, CA 94025",(650) 924-5905,http://www.cyngn.com/,Cyngn,Financial Information,$224.91mil,$0 mil (last 12 months),$-7.67 mil (last 12 months),IPO Profile,CYN,NASDAQ,3.5,$7.50 - $7.50,$26.5 mil,Aegis Capital Corp.,-,10/20/2021,Priced,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,Available only to Subscribers,
General Information,"We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing the next-generation of precision oncology medicines that inhibit DNA damage repair and cause cancer cell death through a therapeutic strategy known as synthetic lethality. Synthetic lethality represents a clinically validated approach to drug development and arises when there is a deficiency in either of two conditions that are tolerable alone in cells but lethal together. Our lead program, CYT-0851, as well as our next generation drug candidate CYT-1853, exploits a novel gain-of-function synthetically lethal relationship between overexpression of a family of DNA damaging genes called cytidine deaminases, or CDs, and functional inhibition of homologous recombination, or HR, a DNA repair pathway critical for the survival of some cancers. CYT-0851 is a novel, oral small molecule inhibitor of RAD51-mediated HR and, to our knowledge, is the only such inhibitor of RAD51-mediated HR in clinical development.
